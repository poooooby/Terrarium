-- Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod: a full 3D diorama overworld, shipped as a
-- rendering pipeline mod.
--
-- The engine's render_pipelines registry (src/mods/Schemas.lua) lets a mod
-- own part of the frame.  This mod registers two:
--
--   voxel      a drawWorld pipeline.  Instead of the flat tile blit, the
--              overworld's terrain is extruded into real geometry, walked
--              by a depth-buffered 3D camera, with characters as leaning
--              sprite slabs and a shadow map throwing real cast shadows
--              across whatever they land on.  Occlusion is the depth
--              buffer, not a y-sort: walk behind a building and the
--              building is simply in front.
--
--   tiltshift  a worldPresent pipeline -- the stage that post-processes
--              the finished world BEFORE the UI composites over it.  A
--              tilt-shift blur that sells the miniature-model look, on the
--              diorama only, leaving text boxes and menus crisp.
--
-- Everything a display mode needs beyond the two draw functions -- the
-- OFF/15/35/50 ladder, the options rows, the hotkeys, persistence in
-- save.options.pipelines, the free-roam gate, the mutual exclusion with
-- the engine's TILT mode -- is engine plumbing driven by the records
-- below.  This file declares; lib/ draws.
--
-- Nothing here reaches collision, movement, triggers or scripts.  Voxel
-- mode is purely presentational: it changes what the world LOOKS like and
-- nothing about what it IS.

-- The scene canvas's size, in FRAMEBUFFER PIXELS.
--
-- `ctx.width/height` are the window measured in LOVE UNITS
-- (love.graphics.getDimensions), but the engine composites a pipeline's
-- returned canvas with `draw(canvas, 0, 0, 0, 1/dpiX, 1/dpiY)` -- a scale
-- that only covers the window when the canvas is at PIXEL resolution.
-- Sizing it in units costs the DPI scale TWICE: the canvas is that much
-- smaller, then it is drawn that much smaller again, so the diorama lands
-- in the top-left corner at 1/dpi of the screen.  Desktop never sees it --
-- units and pixels are the same thing there -- but on Android the DPI scale
-- is the display density (2.625 on a 420dpi panel), and the world came out
-- a third of the size in each direction.
--
-- So ask for the pixel dimensions rather than trusting the ctx.  That is
-- the number a fixed engine would hand over, so this keeps working either
-- way instead of double-correcting.  It also squares the FX pass: ctx.scale
-- is ALREADY in pixels per world pixel (Zoom.scale over Renderer:fitScale,
-- which measures the drawable), so the closures ctx.drawFx runs were being
-- scaled for a canvas 2.6x bigger than the one they drew into.
-- The world-pixel scale the last drawWorld ran at, so the weather can be
-- re-painted after the blur (see the T-SHIFT worldPresent) at the same
-- scale the diorama under it was drawn at. worldPresent is handed a canvas
-- and not the frame's context, and inventing a scale there would put the
-- splashes at a different size from the world they are landing on.
local weatherScale = 1

-- The world-pixel VIEW HEIGHT the last drawWorld ran at, for the same
-- reason weatherScale exists: the SM64 camera's distance ladder is

-- context to read it from. 144 until the first frame has drawn, which is

-- Printed -- stdout is logcat on Android and the launcher's log on desktop --

    DayNight.update(dt)

    -- its own, because it owns no pass of the FRAME: it draws under a battle
    -- screen the engine composites, which is not a stage the registry has.
    -- What it needs is a tick that keeps running once the overworld stops
    -- being the top state, and this is one -- Game:update calls
    -- Pipelines.update unconditionally, so it survives the transition wipe
    -- and the whole battle. Ahead of the active() gate below, because a 3D
    -- battle does not require the free-roam mode to be switched on.
    OverworldBattle.update(dt)
    -- The wild Pokemon standing in the grass ride the same hook for one of
    -- the same two reasons: it is the tick that keeps running whatever is on
    -- top, which is what lets the population notice a map arriving while a
    -- warp's transition still covers the screen. The other reason does not
    -- apply and the module gates on it itself -- nothing may be spawned into
    -- the world while a battle owns the cast list. Ahead of the active()
    -- gate, because what is standing in the grass is not a question about
    -- the camera.
    WildRoamers.update()
    -- The ambient life -- butterflies, fireflies, birds, wind-blown leaves
    -- -- keeps its clocks on the same tick, and gates itself down to the
    -- frames where there is a diorama on screen to be alive on.
    AmbientLife.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- Advanced on real seconds, so a sheet drawn at 30fps lasts the wall
    -- time it was drawn for whatever the game's frame rate is doing.
    Vfx.update(dt)
    -- The weather, on the same tick and AHEAD of everything that reads it.
    -- It is not a drawing with a clock, it is a clock several other things
    -- read: this call is what writes DayNight.overcast and Water.wet for the
    -- frame, so the sky, the hour's tint and the pond's glint all take their
    -- values from a shower that has already advanced rather than from the one
    -- before it. Ahead of the active() gate too, because a shower is a fact
    -- about Kanto and not about the camera -- it keeps building while you are
    -- in a fight, and the 2D world darkens under it either way.
    Weather.update(dt)
    -- and what the weather LEAVES: the ground soaking through a shower and
    -- drying out over the ten minutes after it, the snow settling and
    -- melting, the footprints filling back in. Immediately behind Weather,
    -- because it reads the number that call just wrote -- and ahead of the
    -- active() gate for the same reason the shower itself is: how wet the
    -- ground is is a fact about Kanto, so it keeps soaking while you are
    -- indoors, in a fight, or playing with the camera switched off.
    GroundFX.update(dt)
    -- and the air itself, made visible. BEHIND Weather, because the gust
    -- envelope it throws its fronts off is advanced by Wind.step and that
    -- call is inside Weather's tick -- reading it ahead of that would spawn
    -- every front one frame late and off the previous gust. Gated on the
    -- camera unlike the two above, and honestly so: dust blowing across a
    -- meadow is a DRAWING, not a fact about Kanto, and there is nothing for
    -- it to blow across on the flat 2D path.
    WindFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what a boot does to the ground it crosses. BEHIND WindFX so the
    -- air its motes read (Wind.step ran inside Weather's tick above) is
    -- this frame's; its own field, because WindFX clears when the wind
    -- drops under FLOOR and a footstep makes dust in dead calm.
    StepFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())

    -- the foam trail, the splash in and the drip out (lib/WakeFX.lua)
    WakeFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what comes down off the roofs and the trees: slabs letting go of
    -- the eaves on their own, crowns shaken by a bump or a gust. Behind
    -- GroundFX (it reads the cover that tick wrote) and behind Wind for
    -- the reason the dust is; its own field, because a roof lets go in a
    -- dead calm.
    SnowFallFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and everybody's breath, while it is cold out
    BreathFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and the rain running down the people in it: how much reaches each
    RainOnFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and the snow lying on them: the same question for the other sky, and
    -- behind SnowFallFX because a branch's load lands on a figure in that
    -- update and this one decides what that figure then sheds
    SnowOnFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what the wind takes off the plants. Behind WindFX because it
    -- emits INTO that module's field, which the update above has just
    -- capped, cleared or stepped for this frame.
    VegFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and where those leaves go: down through the same air, onto the
    -- ground, and aside under whoever walks through them. After VegFX, so
    -- a leaf shed this frame falls this frame.
    LeafFallFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what it tears off the water. Same field, same reason, and the
    -- water's own size (WaterBody.sizeAt) is the emission probability --
    -- a harbour whips spray, a fountain pond does not.
    SprayFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what the houses are burning. Behind WindFX for the reason the
    -- footstep dust is: the air its puffs climb through is this frame's.
    -- Its own field, because a chimney smokes hardest in a dead calm,
    -- which is exactly when WindFX clears its own.
    HearthFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what the tower of graves breathes out. Same field discipline as
    -- the hearths: its own small pool, the shared solver's air.
    GhostFX.update(dt, Voxel.active())
    -- and what it sounds like out there. Also ahead of the gate, and for a
    -- plainer reason than the weather's: a sound needs no camera, so the
    -- crickets come out at night on the flat 2D world too.
    AmbientSound.update(dt)
    -- The street Pokemon ride the same tick and gate themselves exactly
    -- like the wild ones do -- and like them, they are real map objects,
    -- so they walk the flat 2D world too.
    CityLife.update()
    -- and what the town DOES about the weather: when it comes down hard the
    -- civilians walk to the nearest door and stand in it, and the street
    -- Pokemon go in and are gone until it passes. Immediately BEHIND
    -- CityLife, because it drops that module's cast and sets the flag that
    -- stops it refilling the street behind them -- and behind Weather for
    -- the plainer reason that it reads the shower that call just advanced.
    Shelter.update()
    -- and what the people do the rest of the time. Behind Shelter because
    -- both write `facing` and the rain outranks a conversation: somebody
    -- walking to a door has already been taken out of the routine's hands
    -- (it skips anybody carrying `dsShelter`), and running them the other
    -- way round would spend a frame with the two disagreeing.
    Routines.update(dt)
    -- and where they are, as opposed to where they are looking. Behind the
    -- beats for the same reason those are behind Shelter: both write to the
    -- same people, and the one that moves a body should see the frame the
    -- one that turns a head already settled. It stands down entirely while
    -- Shelter holds the town, so rain still outranks the clock.
    Routines.agendaUpdate(dt)
    -- and the sleeper indoors, which is a real map object for the same
    -- reason and gates itself the same way. Its steam is a drawing and waits
    -- for the overlay; the cat itself is standing there in both modes.
    Interiors.update()
    -- and the quality-of-life watchers (auto-repel), same tick, same gates
    QoL.update()
    -- how much fits in the bag, kept in step with the two rows. Polled for
    -- the same reason voidFill is: the value can move from the OPTIONS row,
    -- the mod manager and applyOptions on a load, and none of them says so.
    Carry.update()
    -- what is buried on this map. Rebuilt only when the map CHANGES -- the
    -- glints re-check `hiddenTaken` per frame in the draw, so walking over
    -- one puts its own light out with nothing having to announce it.

-- a world pipeline owns the pass.
--
-- Game:keypressed still has to be wrapped: settings without a pipeline have
-- no registry hotkey route, and the VOXEL key walks a custom ladder that
-- skips FULL. Polling in update() would fire alongside the engine instead
-- of instead of it.
--
-- Everything the engine does around a pipeline hotkey has to happen here
-- too, so the work is DELEGATED rather than reimplemented: Pipelines.hotkey
-- applies its own gate and ladder, and the lines after it are the engine's
-- own (syncOptions, the tilt exclusion, writeOptions).

-- ------- CAMERA-RELATIVE MOVEMENT
--
-- THE ONE PLACE THIS MOD TOUCHES CONTROL. Everything else in it is
-- presentational and says so; this is not, and it is here deliberately.
--
-- SM64 makes the stick camera-relative -- push away from yourself and
-- Mario runs away from you, whatever the camera is doing. Without it an
-- orbiting camera is not a camera, it is a puzzle: the world turns
-- underneath you and Up keeps meaning north, so walking a straight line
-- means re-deriving which button is "forward" every time the camera
-- swings. The first cut of this port refused to do it for the sake of the
-- "purely presentational" line, and refusing was the wrong call.
--
-- What is remapped is only WHICH BUTTON the movement loop consults for a
-- given world direction. The world itself is untouched and still speaks
-- compass in every direction that matters: collision, ledges, warps,
-- scripted walks and the sprite sheet all still take "north" to mean
-- north. Press up under a quarter turn and the player genuinely walks
-- west -- the same walk, through the same collision, as if west had been
-- pressed.
--
-- Gated three ways, and each gate earns its place:
--
--   the rung        SOFT pins the camera, so there is nothing to correct
--                   for and the controls are left exactly alone. OFF, the
--                   same. Only a camera that can TURN rotates input.
--   the free-roam   no diorama, no rotation. The flat 2D world is drawn
--                   north-up and always was.
--   the stack top   a menu is not the overworld. Screens read the same
--                   four buttons for their cursors, and a bag that scrolls
--                   sideways because the camera is pointed east would be
--                   an unambiguous bug.
--
-- Wrapped at Input:isDown rather than inside the controller because the
-- controller's movement loop is one `for` over the four names in the
-- middle of a long function, with no seam of its own -- and because this
-- way the shape of the change is exactly one sentence: the four direction
-- queries answer about a rotated world, and every other button is passed
-- through untouched.

-- ------- keeping the geometry in step with the world
--
-- Terrain meshes are derived from a map's block layer, so anything that
-- rewrites a block (a cut tree, a smashed rock, a script's replaceBlock)
-- has to drop that map's cached mesh or the 3D world keeps showing the
-- tree that is no longer there.  The 2D tile renderer invalidates its own
-- caches off the same edit.

-- refresh, not invalidate: the stale mesh keeps drawing while the
-- replacement builds in the background, so a one-block edit (Cut, a
-- door stamp, the tree regrowing on re-entry) repopulates in place
-- instead of blinking the whole scene down to the flat 2D path
mod.events:on("world.block_replaced", function(payload)
  local mapId = payload and (payload.mapId or (payload.map and payload.map.id))
  if mapId then ChunkMesher.refresh(mapId) end
  -- and the ground decals with it: a Cut tree is a new cell to stand on,
  -- and therefore a new cell that could hold a puddle
  GroundFX.invalidate(mapId)
end)

-- The event above is the ANNOUNCED edit -- OverworldState:replaceBlock
-- emits it, which is the path Victory Road's barriers and a script's
-- replaceBlock take. Several edits do not go through it:
--
--   Cut          swaps the tree block and rebuilds the 2D renderer
--   the regrowth restores those blocks when the map is re-entered
--   card-key doors are stamped closed on floor load
--
-- all of them writing the block layer directly. Meshes derived from that
-- layer went stale with no announcement -- the cut tree stayed standing,
-- and after a round trip through a door the stump stayed cut because this
-- map's mesh survives in the cache (that is what prevLive is for).
--
-- The engine could announce each of those, and an earlier cut of this
-- work changed it to. That is the wrong place: it edits the game for one
-- mod's benefit, and every future path that writes a block has to
-- remember to do the same. They all funnel through ONE choke point --
-- Map:setBlock -- so wrap that from here instead. Map is a plain
-- metatable shared by every map instance, so this covers all of them,
-- including paths written after this mod.
--
-- Read back rather than trust the argument: setBlock silently ignores an
-- out-of-bounds write, and a stamp that rewrites a block with the value
-- it already held (the door code guards for this, the regrowth does not)
-- is not a change and must not throw the mesh away.

-- toggling 3D-BTL, which is the other row that owns one (BATTLE LAYOUT), or
-- WILD arriving at or leaving OFF, which takes W-COUNT with it.
-- Every other rung returns the same list, and rebuilding on all of them would
-- rerun every mod's ui.options.rows hook once per keypress. The cursor is
-- clamped rather than reset, so it stays on the row it was just used on
-- instead of jumping to the top when the list below it shortens.

-- ------- battles on the map
--
-- The wraps this needs -- OverworldState:pushBattle, BattleState:draw and
-- BattleState:drawHUDs -- all live in lib/OverworldBattle.lua, which is
-- where the reasoning for each one is written down. Installed once, here,
-- so this file keeps naming every engine seam the mod touches.
OverworldBattle.install()

-- ------- the start menu's MAP row
--
-- One wrap, src.ui.StartMenu.new, in lib/StartMenuMap.lua. It puts a row
-- under ITENS that opens the town map directly instead of by way of the bag
-- and the key item -- see that file for why it sits there and not at the top.
V.require("StartMenuMap").install()

-- ------- the start menu, in X/Y art
--
-- One wrap (src.ui.StartMenu.new, to silence the engine's own draw on the
-- INSTANCE) plus the present hooks above. Both halves are needed or the frame
-- carries two menus; see lib/StartMenuXY.lua.
StartMenuXY.install()

-- ------- the town map, as the region it describes
--
-- The map the row above opens, drawn as a voxel Kanto: all 34 outdoor maps
-- standing where the engine's own connection walk puts them, with the sea
-- around them and the water moving.
--
-- Not a present hook, unlike everything else in this file. The town map is
-- an OPAQUE screen and the world stage does not run behind one -- measured
-- at zero present calls with the map open (tests/worldmap_probe4.lua) -- so
-- there is nothing to paint from. It installs its own two wraps instead
-- (src.ui.TownMap.new and Renderer.endFrame); see lib/WorldMap3D.lua.
WorldMap3D.install()

-- ------- the battle text box and its command buttons
--
-- One wrap (BattleState.drawTextArea) plus a draw inside snapHUDs, which is
-- already bound to the world canvas. Both in lib/BattleBoxXY.lua.
V.require("BattleBoxXY").install()

-- ------- the party and the bag, over the diorama
--
-- The engine's own seam for exactly this: StateStack asks the
-- `screen.render_visible` hook before it counts a state toward the visible
-- base, so answering false for the battle's party menu or bag leaves the
-- screen on the stack -- cursor, choices and all -- while the frame's base
-- falls through to the battle and the diorama underneath. The replacement
-- is drawn from snapHUDs; see lib/BattleScreenXY.lua for both halves.
--
-- Gated on OverworldBattle.screensLive, not merely on a session: a battle
-- whose scene broke has no snapHUDs pass, and hiding a screen nobody
-- redraws is a frame with no menu at all.
local BattleScreenXY = V.require("BattleScreenXY")

-- ------- wild Pokemon standing in the grass
--
-- The two seams this needs -- Player:tryMove, which is where walking into
-- one is refused, and OverworldState:talkTo, which is where pressing A at
-- one lands -- live in lib/WildRoamers.lua with the reasoning for each.
--
-- Nothing here reaches the encounter TABLES: which species and how likely
-- each is are still the ROM's, read through the same records the roll reads.
-- What changes is that the roll happens in the open, some distance away,
-- and you can see its answer standing in the grass before you decide
-- whether to walk into it.
WildRoamers.install()

-- ------- Pokemon in the streets
--
-- One seam -- OverworldState:talkTo, chained behind WildRoamers' wrap of
-- the same method -- where pressing A at a street Pokemon becomes a cry
-- and a line of flavour text, or a challenge. lib/CityLife.lua holds the
-- reasoning.
CityLife.install()

-- ------- and asleep on the floor indoors
--
-- The same seam again, chained behind both of the wraps above -- each checks
-- its own mark and passes everything else along -- where pressing A at a
-- sleeping house pet is a slowed cry and a line, and never a battle.
Interiors.install()

-- ------- what the world sounds like
--
-- Registered rather than merely built: every one of these is a Game Boy
-- channel program assembled by the engine's own authoring path
-- (src.audio.ChipAsm, one of the three src modules the loader names as a
-- supported require) and handed to the engine's own sfx registry -- so they
-- are real entries under real ids, and a sound pack can override
-- DS_AMB_CRICKET with a file of its own and be played instead. Nothing here
-- ships an audio asset; the crickets, the birds, the water, the rain and the
-- thunder are all synthesized from about two hundred bytes of note table
-- each. See lib/AmbientSound.lua for what every program is.
--
-- At load time on purpose: assembly touches no love.* at all, so it works on
-- a headless boot and in the manager's dry load, and the registry has the
-- entries before anything can ask to play one.
AmbientSound.register(mod)

-- ------- quality of life
--
-- Three seams, each wrapped in lib/QoL.lua with the reasoning beside it:
-- OverworldState:interact (A at a tree or the water runs the field move
-- the party menu would have), OverworldState:talkTo (A at a boulder wakes
-- STRENGTH), and BattleState:drawTextArea (effectiveness markers on the
-- move menu, from the same TypeChart the damage formula reads).
QoL.install()
Carry.install()
-- Walk-on-ice when frozen, gated on Surf (Soul Badge + party knows SURF).
if Water.installWalk then pcall(Water.installWalk) end

-- ------- three more mercies on the same row
--
-- The box that fills up (the PC follows the catch, and a full box rolls
-- forward instead of refusing a deposit), the bag sorted into pockets, and
-- RENAME on the party submenu. Every one of them rides a hook or an event
-- the engine already put there -- pokemon.caught, ui.list_menu,
-- ui.party.submenu -- plus two constructor wraps for the two menus that
-- have no hook of their own. lib/Comforts.lua holds the reasoning.
Comforts.install(mod)

-- ------- and experience for the whole team
--
-- battle.exp_award, whose own comment in the engine names this exact case.
-- Nothing here computes experience: the engine hands over the helper it
-- uses itself, and this only decides who it is called for.
ExpShare.install(mod)

-- Two more of its mercies ride engine HOOKS rather than wraps, because the
-- engine put hooks exactly where they were needed.
--
-- `movement.speed` exists, in the engine's own words, for "running shoes,
-- dash, etc." -- so holding B to jog goes through the front door. next()
-- first, so a mod loaded before this one that already changed the pace keeps
-- its answer and this only ever takes the faster of the two.
mod.hooks:wrap("movement.speed", function(next, frames, ctx)
  return QoL.runSpeed(next(frames, ctx), ctx)
end)

-- And `evolution.check` is the seam for cancelling or forcing any evolution,
-- which is what a trade evolution on a single machine needs: Kadabra,
-- Machoke, Graveler and Haunter evolve by trade and by nothing else, so four
-- species are simply absent from a solo game. next() FIRST and its yes is
-- final -- a real link trade still evolves them the instant it completes, and
-- this only ever adds a second way in.
mod.hooks:wrap("evolution.check", function(next, game, mon, evo, trigger)
  return QoL.tradeEvolution(next(game, mon, evo, trigger),
                            game, mon, evo, trigger)
end)

-- ------- the auto-farm bot
--
-- One seam of its own -- MoveLearnMenu:enter, where the forget-a-move
-- prompt would otherwise wait for a player who is not driving -- wrapped in
-- lib/AutoFarm.lua with the reasoning beside it. Everything else the bot
-- does goes through the engine's own front door: synthetic presses on the
-- same Input queue the tests and drivers write, which is why every menu,
-- message and battle behaves exactly as if a very fast player were at the
-- keys.
AutoFarm.install()

-- The bot's tick rides `input.step`, the boundary Game:step runs for
-- exactly this class of mod -- "before Input:step promotes queued edges so
-- a button chosen here is visible to this logic tick". next() first, so an
-- accessibility driver or another autoplay mod loaded before this one
-- still gets its buttons in ahead of ours.
mod.hooks:wrap("input.step", function(next, game, dt)
  local out = next(game, dt)
  AutoFarm.update()

end)

-- The blind roll, switched off exactly where this feature has replaced it.
--
-- encounter.roll is the engine's own seam for it (OverworldState:rollEncounter
-- offers every wild pick to this chain and takes nil for "nothing this
-- step"), so no encounter code is touched -- and next() is not called at all
-- on the terrain we cover, which leaves the vanilla RNG draws unspent rather
-- than rolling and discarding.
--
-- Answered per TERRAIN, not per map: `covers` is only true for ground this
-- feature has actually stood something on, so a map with no encounter table,
-- no room, or art that would not bake keeps the dice it has always had. The
-- one thing worse than a blind encounter is no encounter.
mod.hooks:wrap("encounter.roll", function(next, encDef, ctx)
  if WildRoamers.covers(ctx and ctx.terrain) then return nil end
  return next(encDef, ctx)
end)

-- And the hour and the sky on whatever that roll came back with.
--
-- encounter.species is the engine's own second seam, run on a non-nil roll
-- and BEFORE the repel filter, which is exactly the right place: what
-- changes here is which Pokemon it is, and everything downstream -- repel,
-- the ghost rule, the Safari menu, the battle itself -- goes on reading the
-- answer rather than the question.
--
-- This is the path for MIX and for OFF, the two rungs where the dice are
-- still being thrown, so a player who never switched the visible Pokemon on
-- gets the same world. Under ROAM the roll above already returned nil on
-- the terrain this mod covers, so this is never reached there -- the tilt
-- happened when the roamer was placed, in the open, which is the whole
-- point of that row.
--
-- next() first and only then decorated, so a mod that replaces the species
-- outright still has the last word on WHICH creature; this only ever moves
-- the odds inside the map's own table.

-- needs no battle code at all -- and every path that builds a battler goes
-- through it, including a Transform mid-fight.
--
-- next() first, so a sprite-replacing mod loaded before this one still gets
-- the last word on WHICH art is used; this only changes which SIDE is asked
-- for.

-- ------- and the way back out
--
-- The engine wipes INTO a battle with one of the original's eight transitions
-- and cuts straight OUT of it. That cut is between two very different cameras
-- in this mode, so while voxel mode is on the battle fades out, closes behind
-- the black, and the map fades up. The two seams it needs -- BattleState:finish
-- and Renderer:endFrame -- and the reasoning for each live in lib/BattleExit.lua.
--
-- Declared as a transitions record rather than a constant in that file, so the
-- fade is retunable in data exactly like the eight wipes it answers, and a total
-- conversion can make it as long or as short as its own pacing wants.

-- ------- and the hour on the flat world
--
-- The clock reaches the diorama through the voxel shader's own tint uniform,
-- which the 2D tile path never runs -- so with the mode off, the same evening
-- that fell on the diorama left the flat world at permanent noon. One clock,
-- two worlds, one of them ignoring it. DayTint paints the same multiply over
-- the composited flat world, between the world blit and the UI blit; the
-- reasoning for that exact instant is in the file.

-- ------- what time it is
--
-- The cycle's clock rides the SAVE SLOT (save.modData, via mod.save): what
-- time it is in Kanto is a fact about that journey, like where the player is
-- standing. Written on the engine's save.writing event -- the moment before
-- the bytes hit disk -- and read back whenever a save is opened or begun. A
-- save with no clock in it starts at day; that is DayNight.restore's
-- fallback, and also the DAYTIME row's own default.
-- ------- and what the gramado remembers
--
-- Same bucket, same three events, for the same reason: which paths this

-- about the install. A save with no field in it starts with virgin grass,
