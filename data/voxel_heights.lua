-- Voxel world mode: the shape PROFILE -- hand-authored pins over the
-- automatic structure detector, the way a 3dSen game profile pins a
-- graphic to a geometry type.
--
-- Hand-authored by this mod, and read only from here: unlike the tables the
-- ROM extractor writes into the player's own cache, nothing below is
-- extracted, derived or copied from the ROM.
-- Nothing here reaches gameplay, collision or scripts; an entry can only
-- ever change how a tile LOOKS in voxel mode.
--
-- Most of the world needs no entry. The runtime detects structures on its
-- own (src/render/voxel/Structures.lua): it flood-fills each connected
-- drawn thing, voxelizes small props per pixel at their real drawn height
-- with transparency (a 2-row plant is a 16px-tall silhouette, not a box),
-- and raises everything else as a volume whose height is measured from the
-- drawing itself -- repeat-aware, so a 6-row house is 48px while a 40-row
-- border forest is rows of 16px trees, not a monolith.
--
-- Listing a tile here BYPASSES that detection: the tile takes the class's
-- height and art mode, always. Use it where the detector reads art wrong,
-- or from a mod to pin its own tiles. Resolution order per tile:
--
--   1. a group listed under tilesets[<id>] below        (this profile)
--   2. the tile sits in a water cell                    -> "water"
--   3. the tile sits in a WALKABLE cell                 -> "ground"
--   4. tile-level fallback: the map's water set -> "water", its walkable
--      list -> "ground", anything left over             -> "wall"
--
-- Rules 2-3 work at CELL granularity (16x16, the walk grid) because that
-- is the granularity collision actually has: the engine judges a cell by
-- its bottom-left tile alone, so the other three tiles of a cell carry no
-- collision meaning -- flowers and grass tufts sit in walkable cells and
-- must stay flat ground even though no walkable list names them.
--
-- Classes (heights in world pixels; a map cell is 16x16):
--   ground / water / void   flat; water recesses so shorelines show a lip
--   ledge / roof / bed      box with the art on its TOP face; partial side
--                           faces crop the art (a 6px ledge face is the
--                           bottom of the lip drawing; a bed is its
--                           mattress drawn from above, lying low)
--   wall / tree / fence / sign / counter / table / desk
--                           box whose SOUTH face folds the 2D artwork
--                           upright, 8px band by band; authored boxes fold
--                           every face and wear their top row's art on top.
--                           A counter is half a cell -- one band, so its
--                           drawn front panel stands and its top stays on top
--   stair_e / stair_w       real steps rising toward the named side, the
--                           full cell deep, treads and slices textured
--                           from the drawn staircase
--   stair_down_e / _down_w  a sunken stairwell: the cell opens into a
--                           hole with steps descending toward the named
--                           side -- stairs that lead DOWN a floor
--   relief                  a prop drawn from above (a console on the
--                           floor): the drawing stays flat and the
--                           pixels inside its black outline extrude a
--                           few voxels, art on top
--   bookcase                a free-standing shelf drawn tall: each rank
--                           collapses onto a one-cell-deep box at its
--                           full drawn height; back rows become hidden
--                           floor, and an unpinnable trim row above
--                           becomes the cap
--   billboard / prop        a prop drawn face-on: a standing per-pixel
--                           cutout, black-outline segmented; drawn above
--                           a pinned box it stands ON that box (a
--                           monitor on its desk).  prop is a second pool
--                           so two touching cutouts stay separate
--
-- A tileset entry may also carry `prop_ground` (not a class): a map of
-- prop tile id -> ground tile id naming the tile painted under that
-- pinned prop, overriding the flat-neighbour vote -- the cuttable bush
-- stands on the grass Cut leaves behind, whatever borders it.
--
-- And `prop_bg` (not a class either): which GB shades count as BACKGROUND
-- when a pinned per-pixel prop is cut out, for the drawings whose own body
-- reaches the edge of their bounding box and so vote themselves away.
-- Keyed by tile, because two props sharing an atlas can want opposite
-- answers on the same shade.
--
-- And it may carry `figures` (not a class either): hand-drawn pixel masks
-- that lift a FIGURE PAINTED INTO furniture off it and stand it up as a
-- standee, leaving the furniture its own geometry.  A pin resolves a
-- whole 8x8 tile, so it can never separate two things that share one --
-- and nothing automatic can either when the figure has no background
-- margin to flood from and wears the same shades as what it sits on.
-- The Pokemon Center's seated man is the case; see POKECENTER below for
-- the format.
--
-- Whole BUILDINGS are not tile pins -- one drawing packs a roof seen from
-- above, a facade seen face-on and sloped ends as diagonal silhouettes,
-- and no single class covers that.  They live in the `buildings` list at
-- the bottom of this file, as a band table over the drawing's rows.

    -- levels, and the game's own collision data says which is which.
    -- data.field.tilePairs forbids stepping between $20/$21/$2A/$41 and
    -- $05 on land, and between $14 and $05 while SURFING -- but nothing
    -- forbids $14 <-> $20.  Read that back and the elevation falls out:

    -- step above both, and the rock is the room around them.

    -- NO CAVE SURFACE SITS BELOW 0.  The datum is the dark floor; the
    -- water is level with it (you surf off a pool straight onto the dark
    -- floor, which is exactly what the missing $14/$20 tile pair says);
    -- every other surface is above it.  A cave is underground, not
    -- underwater, and the only class in this file that goes negative is
    -- `water` (-2), which exists to cut the overworld's shoreline lip.
    -- It is deliberately NOT used anywhere in this entry.  The one thing
    -- that does reach below the datum is the DOWN ladder's stairwell,
    -- which is a hole on purpose: it is the shaft to the floor below,
    -- and no walkable surface is drawn in it.
    --
    -- What the detector made of it: the rock EDGES towered.  A shelf's
    -- side is drawn as a cap over a run of face tiles over a corner
    -- pair -- $04 / $31 x5 / $28 / $10 down one column -- and the volume
    -- builder's repeat scan anchors on the column's FRONT tile, which
    -- here is a one-off corner that never recurs above it.  Neither the
    -- repeat read nor the trim rule (two identical rows directly above
    -- the front) fires, so the column keeps its whole extent and caps at
    -- MAX_ROWS: a 48px fin out of the 16px band beside it, while the
    -- column one tile west -- ending on $28 with two $31 above -- reads
    -- 16.  Probed before pinning: MT_MOON_B2F tiles (5,4)-(5,11) and
    -- (17,8)-(17,15) at 48 with 16 either side; VICTORY_ROAD_2F
    -- (25,26)-(25,31); SEAFOAM_ISLANDS_B4F (22,0)-(22,7),
    -- (13,12)-(13,19) and (12,13)-(12,19).  The same reading turns a
    -- column of four DIFFERENT rock tiles into 32px -- VICTORY_ROAD_1F
    -- (28,20)-(29,23) and (30,20)-(31,23), $02/$12 over $0C/$1C, next
    -- to identical rock at 16.  An authored tile never reaches the

      -- were walking on, and `ground` (flat, at the floor plane, wearing

      -- (7/9/8 or 17/18 over 50/51).  A pin is per tile id and a class
      -- carries one height, so the two uses cannot be separated here at
      -- all -- only in `lib`, by letting a pin be conditional on the tile
      -- drawn ABOVE (see reports/COUNTERS_pass2.md).  Pinned `wall` (16)
      -- the band is one clean face and the counter the guard stands
      -- behind is a full 16px slab that hides him to the shoulders.
      -- Pinned `counter` (8) every counter is the half cell it is drawn
      -- as -- which is what the room is FOR -- and the price is that the
      -- wall cell's front 8px of depth drops with it: a shallow wall
      -- gains an 8px plinth (reads as a wainscot), and the deep margin
      -- masses that run two to eight cells north-south down the east and
      -- west sides of the fourteen maps that place both drawings (Routes
      -- 5/6/7/8, the five gate 1Fs, the Safari gate and its four rest
      -- houses) corrugate, their exposed flank stepping 16/8/16/8 every
      -- 8px of depth.  The other six -- Route 2, Route 22 and the four
      -- Underground Path huts -- place 50/51 and never 32/33, so they
      -- take the half cell for nothing.  The counters win where it costs:
      -- they are the object the player walks up to and talks over, they
      -- sit mid-room, and the margin masses are pure border filler seen
      -- edge-on.  This also puts GATE and FOREST_GATE on the same footing

    -- The approach to the Pokemon League: two maps, INDIGO_PLATEAU (the
    -- forecourt the League itself stands on) and ROUTE_23 (the long
    -- climb up to it, with its badge-check gates).  Everything this
    -- blockset draws is one piece of architecture -- striated rock
    -- walls, white pillars, and the bird STATUES that line both the
    -- avenue and the plaza.  29 of its 73 blocks are never placed, so
    -- every tile named below really is one of these two maps'.
    --
    -- A statue is built exactly like the badge gyms' (see GYM above):
    -- one cell of FIGURE ($10/$12 over $28/$29) standing on one cell of
    -- PLINTH ($15/$16 the cap over $30/$31 the plaque).  47 of them --
    -- 12 on INDIGO_PLATEAU, six a side down the avenue, and 35 more
    -- across ROUTE_23's plaza (blocks $42/$43; the $25/$26 twins that
    -- stand the same statue on grass are never placed).
    --
    -- What the detector made of them is the bug this entry exists for.
    -- On the avenue the statues stack with NO gap: the plinth's plaque
    -- row is drawn directly above the next figure's head, so the
    -- flood-fill joined all six of a column into ONE region 24 tile rows
    -- tall, and the volume builder's repeat scan read 32px down one half
    -- of the drawing and 24px down the other.  Each row came out as a
    -- continuous stepped RIDGE of boxes wearing the statue art folded
    -- onto its south face -- probed INDIGO_PLATEAU tiles (16,12)-(17,35)
    -- at 32/24 and (22,12)-(23,35) mirrored.  ROUTE_23's plaza statues
    -- stand alone and fared no better: 24px boxes with the figure's top
    -- row skipped outright.
    --
    -- Pinned the gyms' way the ridge becomes statues.  The plinth is a
    -- SOLID 16px `wall` block; the figure is a per-pixel cutout 5 voxels
    -- deep (the thin `prop` pool) that rides the plinth's top face
    -- through the authored-box support rule and collapses to the
    -- plinth's SINGLE cell of footprint -- Structures' wall-support case,
    -- so the base never marches backwards.
    --
    -- The one thing the gyms did not have to deal with: $28/$29 is
    -- SHARED.  The same bird is drawn again at the foot of every white
    -- pillar, framed there by the pillar's black edge ($25/$26 over that
    -- same $28/$29, blocks $18/$1B) -- 80 of them, 76 down ROUTE_23 and
    -- four on INDIGO_PLATEAU (its two outer corners and the pair
    -- flanking the League's recess).  So $25/$26 joins the same pool:
    -- pinning half a cell would have stood a half-height bird under a
    -- wall.  That in turn is why the pillar itself is pinned -- see the
    -- last paragraph of `wall`.
