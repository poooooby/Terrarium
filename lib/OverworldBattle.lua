-- Overworld battles: fights that happen on the map you were standing on.
--
-- The engine's battle is a screen: a white field with two pics on it, pushed
-- over a frozen overworld that stops drawing. This turns that white field
-- into the world -- the same terrain the free-roam mode extrudes, shot from
-- a placed over-the-shoulder camera at a clear patch of ground nearby --
-- while leaving the battle ITSELF alone. Every pic, HUD, HP bar, move
-- animation, faint slide and text box is the engine's own, drawn in the
-- engine's own order. What changes is what is behind them, and where the two
-- pics stand.
--
-- The sequence, from the moment something picks a fight:
--
--   1. the overworld cast is culled -- every NPC vanishes, so the wipe
--      plays over an empty map and no bystander is left standing in the
--      arena shot
--   2. the engine's own transition wipes the screen (untouched: it is the
--      right wipe, picked by the right three bits)
--   3. the battle draws over a live, window-resolution render of the arena,
--      with each mon PINNED to the cell it is standing on, the camera
--      drifting slowly enough to read as parallax, and a depth-of-field pass
--      holding the slab of world the two of them occupy sharp
--   4. the battle ends, the cast comes back, and the player is exactly
--      where they were standing
--
-- WHAT DOES NOT MOVE. The arena is where the CAMERA goes, not where the
-- player goes: nothing here writes a cell, a facing, a flag or a warp. A
-- real warp would have to survive trainer sight-lines, post-battle
-- dialogue, the blackout path and every script that assumes the player is
-- where it left them -- and it would have to put them back afterwards.
-- Moving the camera buys the whole shot and owes nothing back.
--
-- The feature declines cleanly rather than half-working: no depth support,
-- no open ground on the map, the row switched off, or a mesh still building
-- all end at the same place, which is the battle screen the engine has
-- always drawn.

-- by: your own Pokemon, seen from behind, big in the foreground. That
-- silhouette is the series' shot.
--
-- So BACK SPRITES puts the back view back -- and keeps the mon IN the

-- Gen 5 back sprite when it has one) and stands on its own cell the way the
-- foe does: a card in the 3D pass, depth-tested, shadow-mapped, under the
-- hour's light, and grown by BACK_HERO so it reads as the foreground hero
-- the classic 2x slot made it. Nothing else about the shot moves -- the
-- arena, the camera and the drift are solved exactly as they were.
--
-- It used to be the GB's own flat pic, pinned over the finished frame in
-- the GB's own slot. That put the one thing in the fight that was not
-- geometry ABOVE everything that was: the move fan, the panels and the
-- capsules are drawn into the world canvas, and the UI canvas composites
-- over that -- so the mon sat on top of its own move cards, and had to be
-- tucked (shrunk to half) to get out of their way. The pin is still the
-- fallback for a frame whose texture could not be rendered (see

-- points are the pics' FEET, they hold for every species at every scale (the
-- engine's placement helpers pin the bottom edge and the centre), and they
-- are what BattleCam is solved to put the two arena cells under.
--
-- Which makes the pin a subtraction: whatever the drift has done to the
-- camera this frame, each pic moves by its own cell's projected position
-- minus its anchor. At the middle of the drift that is zero.
OverworldBattle.ANCHOR = {
  player = { 26, 96 },
  enemy = { 124, 56 },

-- ------- how big a mon is
--
-- Not a decision made here. A pic is drawn at its own integer scale -- 1x for
-- a 56px front pic, 2x for a 32px back one -- because that is the only way it
-- keeps every pixel the artist drew, and the CAMERA is solved so that one
-- overworld square is that big on screen (see BattleCam). The mon fits its
-- tile because the tile was sized to the mon, not the other way round.
OverworldBattle.SLOT_W = { front = 56, back = 32 }

-- ------- the box at the bottom, on the same glass
--
-- The HUDs got frosted panels because black glyphs on grass are not readable.
-- The battle's text box and its menu had the opposite problem and the same
-- cause: they are drawn as an OPAQUE WHITE slab with a black border, which was
-- the field's own colour when the field was white and is a sheet of paper laid
-- over the bottom third of the diorama now that it is not.
--
-- So the box gets exactly what the HUDs get: the world behind it, blurred to
-- frosted glass and laid back down translucent, with the border and the text
-- drawn over it unchanged, and the same brightness verdict flipping the ink
-- when the ground under it is dark. Only the FILL is taken away -- every glyph
-- the engine draws inside the box is still the engine's own, in its own place.
--
-- These are the boxes BattleState:drawTextArea lays down, as GB-frame rects.
-- READ-ONLY duplicates of that function's own branches, the same kind of
-- mirror hudLive is and for the same reason: there is no seam that reports "a
-- move menu is up", and glass has to go down BEFORE the box that sits on it.
-- The worst a future engine change can do is frost a rectangle nothing lands
-- on, or leave a box unfrosted -- never break a battle.

-- panels over the same pixels would frost it twice and leave a visible step

-- ------- the HUDs, out at the window's own edges
--
-- The battle screen is 160x144 in the MIDDLE of the window and the world is the
-- whole of it. That left both HUD blocks huddled together in the middle of the
-- frame with map showing on either side of them, which reads as a Game Boy
-- screenshot pasted over a diorama rather than as the diorama's own furniture.
--
-- So each block is snapped to its own side: the foe's to the left edge of the
-- window, the player's to the right. Nothing about either block changes -- same
-- tiles, same size, same rows, drawn by the engine's own DrawEnemyHUDAndHPBar
-- and DrawPlayerHUDAndHPBar -- only where the pair sits. On a window the shape
-- of the GB screen there is nowhere to go and the snap is a no-op.
--
-- They cannot simply be MOVED there: the engine draws them into the 160x144 UI
-- canvas and everything outside it is clipped away. So the layer is rendered to
-- a texture and composited into the WORLD image instead, which is the one
-- surface in this mode that covers the whole window.

-- The rows each block is cut out of, full width. Generous on purpose:
-- AnimationShakeEnemyHUD nudges the foe's block sideways, a long name reaches
-- further than the panel does, and the pokeball rows and the safari ball count
-- belong to the block whose rows they sit in. Nothing drawHUDs draws lies
-- outside rows 0-96, and the two bands split that between them.

-- Everything this file composes is measured in the GB's own 160x144 frame: the

-- -- the mons would stand where no camera was solved for them, and the panels
-- would land beside the HUDs they are supposed to be under.
--
-- So while a fight can be staged on the map there is one right answer, and it
-- is SET rather than worked around. The engine reads the option live
-- (BattleState:isWideBattleLayout is asked per frame, and Renderer asks the

-- off the list and pins the value while 3D-BTL is on (see main.lua), so a
