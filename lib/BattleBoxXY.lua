-- The battle's text box and command buttons, at the window's resolution.
--
-- Same problem the start menu had and the same answer: the engine draws its
-- box into the 160x144 UI canvas, so anything drawn THERE arrives on screen
-- at Game Boy resolution. This draws into the world canvas instead, from
-- inside OverworldBattle.snapHUDs, which is already bound to it.
--
-- WHAT IS REPLACED. The box's frame and fill, the message text, the four
-- commands -- drawn as buttons rather than as two columns of words with an
-- arrow beside one of them -- and the move list, drawn as one row per move
-- in the move's own type colour, with the type icon, the PP count and a
-- card for the selected move where the Game Boy put its TYPE/ box.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT. Which commands and moves exist, which one is highlighted,
-- what the message says, and how fast it types. All of it is read off the
-- battle every frame: `menuIndex` (1..4 in reading order, found by moving
-- the cursor and watching which field changed), `moveIndex`,
-- `player.curMoves`, `current.text`, and `charIndex`, which is the
-- typewriter's own cursor -- honouring it is what keeps the text appearing
-- a letter at a time instead of all at once.
--
-- EVERYTHING FITS IN THE BOX'S OWN RECT. The first cut of this menu grew
-- the panel to 1.9x the box's height, full width -- measured on a 1080p
-- window that is a 1200x684 slab, which buried the player's own mon and
-- most of the arena the mode exists to show. Nothing here leaves the
-- bottom third now: the message keeps to the left of the box, the buttons
-- and the move rows float on the right, and the world stays visible above
-- them. That is also what lets the player's HUD capsule sit still -- it
-- used to step upward to dodge the grown panel.
--
-- THE LABELS ARE THE GAME'S. The 5X pack draws its command buttons with the
-- words baked in, in English -- POKéMON, BAG, RUN -- and gen1recomp itself
-- runs in English (see lib/Lang.lua), so the art's own labels agree with
-- the rest of the frame by default. `label` is only the fallback text drawn
-- when the art fails to load (see `button` below); Lang.setting lets a
-- player switch that fallback to Portuguese without touching the art.

--

-- (see its install()). Idempotent for the same reason.
--
-- Only the box: the HUDs are lib/BattleHudXY.lua's and the pics are the
-- engine's own. And only while this can actually draw, so a driver that
-- cannot load the font still gets the Game Boy's box rather than none.
-- Silence this ONE battle's box, on the instance.
--
-- The class wrap below could not win: `BattleState.drawTextArea` is a
-- different function by the time a battle is running than it was at install
-- time -- three wrappers in this mod alone plus a separate `quality_of_life`
-- mod all reassign it, and whichever captured its `inner` first and assigned
-- last leaves everyone else's wrapper pointing at a chain nobody calls.
--
-- An instance field does not have to win that argument. Lua looks at the
-- object before the metatable, so this shadows whatever the class currently
-- holds, however many wrappers deep it is -- and it dies with the battle, so
-- nothing outlives the fight. Same trick the start menu uses on its own
-- instance, and for the same reason.
