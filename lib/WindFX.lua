-- Voxel world mode: the wind you can SEE.
--
-- Wind.lua bends the grass; this file fills the air when grass is not on
-- screen. What it fills it with is the animated strips in WindFX.SHEETS
-- (Pimen's swoosh, crescent, puff, vortex and dust kick) and the coloured
-- leaf strip -- and the RULES written above that table, which are the
-- whole point of this file.
--
-- Kinds the wind itself spawns (picked by weather + wind strength):
--   ribbon   the swoosh, aligned to travel        (dry, more in a gale)
--   curl     a small crescent turning over        (dry breeze)
--   leaf     a leaf tumbling, three colourways    (any dry air, rain)
--   wetpuff  a small puff, tinted like the spray  (rain, snow)
--   kick     dust thrown off the ground           (dry gust front only)
--   whirl    a vortex standing on the ground      (gale gust front only)
--
-- Kinds only WindFX.emit's callers spawn (VegFX, SprayFX, StepFX), drawn
-- as the authored cel stamps (assets/vfx/wind_*.png from
-- tools/make_wind_sprites.py): grit, seed, dash, spray, snow, puff.
--
-- Gust front: a rank of ribbons across the view + the ground kicked once
-- (+ the whirl, sometimes), on the same Wind.gust envelope the grass
-- already bows to.

-- ------- THE DOWNLOADED SHEETS, AND THE RULES THEY PLAY BY
--
-- Five strips cut from Pimen's Wind Spell Effect 01/02 and Smoke n Dust 03
-- (tools/install_pimen_wind.py; provenance and licence in
-- assets/vfx/LICENSE.md). They replace an earlier set of OpenGameArt sheets
-- whose first wiring put them INTO the standing field: every grain, puff
-- and dash became a 96 px animation, turned by its own spin, its clip
-- stretched over a random lifetime, up to three hundred of them at once.
-- Pretty, and noise -- because a sheet is not a mote. A mote is a thing
-- the air carries; a sheet is an EVENT with a beginning and an end. So:
--
--   1. The air's sheets (ribbon, curl, wet puff) ARE the standing field, a
--      few at a time (STANDING_MAX), each born inside the view. The ground
--      sheet (dust kick) and the hero (whirl) play only at a GUST FRONT
--      -- the Wind.gust envelope the grass bows to -- with slots kept for
--      them (FRONT_RESERVE) so a full field cannot crowd the front out.
--   2. A sheet plays its clip once at its own frame rate; its lifetime IS
--      the clip's length, never a random draw. The two that loop (curl,
--      whirl) dwell for a written span (`dwell` + up to `jitter`) instead.
--   3. A sheet keeps its authored up. The ribbon alone follows its travel,
--      and flips instead of turning over when the wind runs left. Nothing
--      spins.
--   4. A sheet has one size, in world px. No per-mote size jitter.
--   5. Ground sheets (whirl, dust kick) stand on the ground under them:
--      no bob, no lift, no flutter.
--   6. At most ONE hero (the whirl) is in the air, and only in a gale --
--      and today none: HERO_CHANCE is 0. A vortex at the player's feet
--      was one more thing happening at the player's feet.
--   7. The grey cel stamps (grit, seed, dash, puff, spray, snow) are not
--      drawn by the wind any more: a screen of grey specks over the path
--      read as dirt on the lens, and the authored 16 px leaf silhouettes
--      read as no leaf at all. Their kinds, images and draw code stay,
--      for WindFX.emit's other callers -- and a "leaf" emitted by VegFX
--      is a sheet now too, so a leaf torn off a tree tumbles like one.
--   8. Dry air plays the swoosh. Wet air plays the puff, tinted like the
--      spray. The ground is kicked only if KICK is on -- it is off: a
--      dust burst on the path read as a fart from nowhere.
--   9. The wind is BACKGROUND. Everything but the leaf rides high -- up
--      by the tree crowns (`band`) -- and faint (`alpha`), so it reads as
--      weather passing over the diorama, never as a thing happening at
--      the player's feet. The leaf is the one piece at eye level and at
--      full strength, because a leaf is a thing and a gust is not.
--
-- A sheet mote is a mote whose kind names a row here. The solver steps it
-- like any other (its own KINDS row says how it moves); only the draw is
-- different, and both draw paths read it through sheetCard() below.
--

-- ------- AND THE SAME FIELD, AS GEOMETRY IN THE SCENE PASS
--
-- The draw above paints into the OVERLAY, which has no depth test by
-- construction -- so every mote in it passed in front of the mountain and
-- through the roof, always. This one hands the field to the scene pass as
-- cards, and the depth buffer answers both.
--
-- Deliberately NOT a rewrite of the look. Image, colour, alpha and angle
-- are read through the very same imgFor / colourFor / climate the overlay
-- draw uses, so the only thing that differs between the two paths is
-- whether the geometry in front of a mote is allowed to hide it. That is
-- what makes the change checkable: anything else that moved is a bug.
--
-- Size does change register, and has to. The overlay sized a mote in
-- SCREEN pixels and multiplied by the projection's own scale to fake
-- perspective; a card of a given WORLD size shrinks with distance because
-- it genuinely is further away. The constants carried over are the old
-- screen numbers read as world pixels -- which is what they always meant
-- at the focus plane, where the projection's scale is one.

-- DRAW through the overlay and VANISH through the scene pass, and put in
-- the open it must survive both. Two frames, two pixel counts, nothing to
-- interpret.

-- clamp, which would otherwise lift a mote placed inside a house up onto
-- its roof and quietly test nothing at all.
