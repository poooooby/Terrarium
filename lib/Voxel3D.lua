-- compute drops straight in with no unit conversion:
--
--   +X  map east   (world-pixel x)
--   +Y  up         (0 is the ground plane)
--   +Z  map south  (world-pixel y)
--
-- A character at rest faces +Z, i.e. toward a camera parked to the south,
-- which is what "facing down" means in the 2D game -- and a character card
-- is drawn in exactly that pose, leaning back rather than yawing.
--
-- The camera orbits the view centre at Voxel.angle: 0 is straight down
-- (what the flat 2D view already is) and 50 degrees leans toward the
-- horizon. Distance and field of view are tied to Voxel.FOCAL, which is the
-- same constant Tilt projects with, so a given angle frames the world
-- identically in both modes -- switching between them changes the geometry,
-- not the framing.

-- headless test runs and any driver without depth-canvas support fall back

// ------- VXFP: fp32 WHERE A WORLD COORDINATE IS ACTUALLY CARRIED
//
// A GLES fragment stage defaults to mediump, which on a phone is fp16 --
// eleven bits of mantissa and a resolution of ONE at a magnitude of 1024.
// This shader works in WORLD PIXELS and a city is more than a thousand of
// them across, so every position was quantised to about a whole world pixel
// on Android and to nothing at all on desktop.  Everything downstream
// inherits it -- the sun lookup, the swell, and above all the hashes, whose
// entire job is to turn a small change of input into a large change of
// output.  Quantisation that shifts as the camera moves, amplified on
// purpose, is what a player reported as television interference.
//
// ------- WHY THIS IS A MACRO AS WELL AS `precision highp float;`
//
// Because raising the default was tried, twice, and both times it went
// wrong in a way no machine here could see.  1.34.0-beta raised the
// fragment stage's DEFAULT precision, and:
//
//   * on desktop it did not compile at all, because LOVE #defines `highp`
//     to nothing under `#version 120`, so the statement became
//     `precision  float;` (caught here by tests/gpu_compat_probe.lua);
//   * and once that was guarded on GL_ES, it took the 3D mode off the phone
//     entirely, because LOVE forward-declares
//     `vec4 effect(vec4, Image, vec2, vec2);` BEFORE this file at its own
//     mediump default, and a definition whose parameters disagree with its
//     prototype does not compile on GLES;
//   * and once THAT was pinned, a Mali-G615 still refused it -- eight
//     refusals on record, every rung, both uniform precisions.  The ladder
//     dropped it and the mode survived, which is the only reason that
//     version was not a third outage.
//
// So VXFP names the declarations that carry a world coordinate and raises
// those, one at a time.  `LOVE_HIGHP_OR_MEDIUMP` is LOVE's own macro --
// highp where the fragment stage has it, mediump where it does not -- and
// it is the construct `vWorld` and `vGrid` have used since the beginning,
// which is to say the construct this exact driver is already compiling
// today.  That is the whole argument for it being safe: it is not new here,
// and the Mali that refused the statement above took every one of these
// (`frag=fp32 refusals=0`, 1.34.2-beta, on the reporter's own screen).
//
// What that version also proved is that a NAMED LIST IS NOT ENOUGH -- see
// the block under this one.  So VXFP is the rung BELOW a raised default
// rather than a replacement for it, and FRAG_HIGHP gates both, because the
// lesson from all three attempts is that a correctness fix which can take
// the mode down is not a fix.  With it off, VXFP is nothing and every
// declaration below reads exactly as it read before this existed.
#ifdef FRAG_HIGHP
  #define VXFP LOVE_HIGHP_OR_MEDIUMP
#else
  #define VXFP
#endif

// ------- AND THE SAME IDEA WITH THE VOLUME TURNED ALL THE WAY UP
//
// VXFP raises the declarations somebody NAMED, and a named list of the
// precision-sensitive declarations in a fifteen-hundred-line fragment shader
// is a list that is wrong.  1.34.2-beta shipped one, this exact Mali-G615
// took it -- `frag=fp32 refusals=0` on the panel -- and the static was still
// there, because the SHADOW LOOKUP was not on the list.  Every local inside
// every function is still whatever the stage defaults to, and on GLES that
// is fp16: `sunDepth` unpacks a sixteen-bit depth out of two bytes into a
// value with about eleven bits of room, and then `step()` compares it
// against a bias tuned for the other five.  The result is a coin flip
// between lit and unlit, per pixel, everywhere the shadow map reaches --
// which is a picture of television interference, and is what the phone was
// showing all along.
//
// So there is a rung ABOVE the named list that simply raises the default,
// and the ladder tries it first.  Both halves of the inner guard are
// load-bearing: GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH is defined on DESKTOP too, where
// LOVE #defines `highp` to nothing, so without `GL_ES` this compiles to
// `precision  float;` and takes the whole shader down.  (It did, twice.)
// And it stays a RUNG rather than becoming a fact, because a Mali refused
// this statement once already and a correctness fix that can take the mode
// down is not a fix -- below it sits the named list, and below that the fp16
// stage every Android build has always run.

// `lowp` -- eight bits over the range [-2,2], which is coarser than the

// map is a two-byte pack whose low byte lives entirely inside that gap.
precision highp sampler2D;

#endif

  // ------- VXHP: the precision of a uniform BOTH stages declare
  //
  // GLSL ES 1.00 links a uniform by name AND by precision qualifier, and the
  // two stages here do not start from the same default: a vertex shader
  // defaults to highp, and LOVE emits `precision mediump float;` at the top
  // of the fragment stage. So a bare `uniform float swellPhase;` sitting in a
  // region both stages compile -- which is most of the water block below,
  // because the vertex displaces the mesh and the fragment re-reads the same
  // wave -- is highp in one and mediump in the other, and that is a LINK
  // ERROR on any driver that reads the spec.
  //
  // Desktop GL never says so (`#version 120` has no precision qualifiers at
  // all, they are #defined away) and neither does Adreno, which tolerates the
  // mismatch. Mali does not: it refuses, and a refused link is
  // Voxel3D.available() == false, which is the whole 3D mode gone with no
  // message -- the same silent failure the rung ladder below was built for,
  // arriving by a different door. The ladder could not catch this one: every
  // rung declares these uniforms, so every rung failed identically.
  //
  // The fix has to make the qualifier textually the same in both stages, and
  // no expression available INSIDE the shader can do that -- the vertex stage
  // cannot see GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH, so any #if that asks about it
  // resolves differently per stage, which is the bug again. So Lua decides,
  // from love.graphics.getSupported().pixelshaderhighp, and injects the value
  // (see PRECISIONS beside the LADDER).
  //
  // There is deliberately no `#ifndef VXHP` default here. A default would have
  // to pick its value from an #if, every #if available resolves per-stage, and
  // a per-stage value IS the bug -- so the safety net would quietly restore
  // exactly what it was put there to catch. Without one, a builder that
  // forgets the define gets an undeclared-identifier error naming VXHP, on
  // every driver including the desktop one this is written on.

-- nothing else. The sun tap count is a define for a different reason: a
-- uniform branch would still cost the four fetches on any driver that
-- schedules both sides, which is most of them.
-- Each entry is nil = untried, false = unavailable.
local shaders = {}

-- Scene canvases, one per NAMED SLOT. There are exactly two callers and

-- single cached canvas made every battle entry and exit reallocate one.

-- ------- rendering under the panel's resolution
--
-- The engine composites a pipeline's canvas with draw(canvas, 0, 0, 0,
-- 1/dpiX, 1/dpiY), which only covers the window when the canvas is at the
-- panel's PIXEL resolution -- so what a caller asks for is not negotiable,
-- and handing back a smaller one would land the diorama in the corner at a
-- fraction of the screen (the bug main.lua's sceneSize exists to have
-- fixed).
--
-- So the reduction happens INSIDE the pass and is undone on the way out:
-- the 3D scene draws into a canvas `RES` times smaller on each axis, and
-- endScene scales that back up into a full-size one that the rest of the
-- frame -- the FX overlay, the tilt-shift pass, the engine's own composite
-- -- sees exactly as it always did. Nothing downstream learns about this,
-- which is the point: project() keeps reporting full-size coordinates and
-- the overlay keeps drawing at ctx.scale.
--
-- Nearest on the way up, deliberately. The world under it is pixel art at
-- a fixed grid and the mode's whole argument is that the grid stays crisp;
-- a bilinear stretch would turn a half-resolution diorama into a smeared
-- one, where nearest turns it into a chunkier one. Chunkier is the right
-- failure for this art.
--
-- At RES FULL the two sizes are equal, no present slot is ever allocated,
-- and the extra blit does not happen at all -- so the desktop path is the

-- down a ladder, stencil-bearing first so the clear below can go on asking

-- ------- VXHP: what precision the shared uniforms are declared at
--
-- See the note at the top of SHADER. The uniforms the water block declares are
-- compiled into BOTH stages, GLSL ES 1.00 links them by precision as well as
-- by name, and the two stages do not default to the same one. The qualifier
-- therefore has to be chosen HERE, where one value can be handed to both
-- compiles, rather than by any #if inside the shader -- the vertex stage
-- cannot see GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH, so every in-shader test resolves
-- per-stage and reproduces the bug.
--
-- highp first because these are world coordinates and a phase that grows all
-- session: `eye` runs to a few thousand world pixels and `swellPhase` climbs
-- without bound, and mediump on a Mali is fp16 -- eleven bits of mantissa,
-- which quantises the swell into visible steps within a minute of play. The
-- mediump rung exists for the drivers that have no fragment highp at all
-- (GLES2 does not require it), where the choice is that or no 3D.
local PRECISIONS = { "highp", "mediump" }

-- The two answers to "may the fragment stage compute in fp32", tried in that
-- order.  `true` is the one that fixes the static on a phone; `false` is the
-- fp16 default GLES gives and what every Android build of this mod ran on
-- until now.  See the FRAG_HIGHP note at the top of SHADER for why it has to
-- be droppable and not merely correct.
-- THREE answers, tried in that order:
--   "global"    raise the fragment stage's DEFAULT precision, so every local
--               in every function computes in fp32.  This is the one that
--               fixes the static outright, and the one a Mali-G615 refused
--               once, which is why it is first and droppable rather than
--               unconditional.
--   "targeted"  raise only the declarations named with VXFP.  1.34.2-beta
--               shipped this alone; the driver took it and the static stayed,
--               because a named list cannot cover a function's locals.  It is
--               kept because it is strictly better than nothing and it is
--               proven to compile on the device that refused the line above.
--   false       the fp16 default GLES gives, which is what every Android
--               build of this mod ran on until 1.34.2.  A picture with
--               static in it is still a picture.

-- ------- THE ALPHA TAG: how a decal tells the screen pass what it IS
--
-- The screen pass has one image and one depth buffer to work from, so for as
-- long as this row has existed a surface's CLASS has had to be guessed out of
-- its geometry. For the sea that guess is sound -- it is the only thing in
-- the world standing in a band below zero. For a puddle it never was: the
-- guess was the fraction of its height (0.7, the float below), and a
-- character is a card leaned back by the camera's pitch whose height climbs
-- its own face and crosses point-seven a dozen times. The probe took that
-- apart, and two further guesses at geometry -- flatness, a strict normal --
-- failed with it. The answer is not a third guess. It is to stop guessing.
--
-- The channel it goes in is the scene canvas's own ALPHA, and it is free for
-- two reasons that hold together:
--
--   NOTHING ELSE IS USING IT for geometry. The canvas is rgba8 and its alpha
--   is meaningful -- the void is transparent, which is why the composite in
--   endScene copies rather than blends -- but every drawn pixel in it is at
--   exactly 1.0 and cannot be at anything else.
--
--   AND NOTHING ELSE CAN LAND ON IT BY ACCIDENT, which is the part that
--   makes this a mask rather than a fourth guess. The alpha blend equation
--   is dst.a = src.a + dst.a * (1 - src.a), so a decal painted at 0.90 over
--   ground at 1.0 still resolves to exactly 1.0, and so does one at 0.78,
--   and so does an additive spark. Every ordinary draw SATURATES this
--   channel. A value that is neither 1.0 nor 0.0 can only have been put
--   there deliberately, outside the blend.
--
-- Which is the whole of the pair below: mask the colour write down to the
-- alpha channel alone, set the blend to replace so dst.a IS src.a, and draw
-- the decal a second time. The first draw's composited colour is untouched
-- -- the mask blocks RGB -- and the only thing that changes in the finished
-- frame is the byte RayFX reads.
--
-- 254 of 255 rather than something further from 1.0, and the cost is worth
-- naming: this value survives the pass (RayFX hands src.a back out) and ends
-- up as the pixel's own opacity at the engine's composite, so a tagged pixel
-- is 0.4% see-through. That is under half a step of the 8-bit art it is
-- drawn over. The reader tests for it exactly rather than for "less than
-- one" -- see RayFX.PUDDLE_TAG, which is this same number written down in
-- the file that reads it, the same way PUDDLE and the decal's float height
-- are written down twice.
