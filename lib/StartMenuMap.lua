-- The town map is the one thing in this game you look at constantly and reach
-- most slowly: Start, ITEM, scroll to the TOWN MAP key item, A, and only then
-- the map -- five inputs and two menus deep to answer "where am I". Every
-- other thing on that menu is one input from the top.
--
-- So it gets a row of its own. Nothing about the map SCREEN changes: the row
-- pushes `src.ui.TownMap`, which is the same screen the key item opens, built
-- the same way (probed: `TownMap.new(game)` takes the game and nothing else,
-- and the screen it returns pushes onto the stack and runs). This file only
-- shortens the route to it.
--
-- WHERE IT SITS. Directly under ITEM, which is where the map lives today --
-- somebody who knows the old route finds the new one on the way to the old
-- one. Not at the top: the first row is POKeDEX and moving it would make a
-- menu people navigate by muscle memory lie to them.

-- was wrong to). MAP is short enough to read as this row's own word rather
-- than a restatement of the item's full name; Lang.setting swaps it to the
-- Portuguese MAPA the previous build printed unconditionally.

-- a small break in the game's own gating; a row that vanishes for no reason

-- inserted into it. Wrapping StartMenu.new rather than Menu.new on purpose:
-- Menu is the class every list in the game is built from, and adding a row to
-- all of them is not what this is for.
--
-- Idempotent, like the battle hooks, so a hot reload cannot stack two rows.
