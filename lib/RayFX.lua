-- Voxel world mode: the screen-space pass -- fake ray tracing.
--
-- Everything in this file is a RAY MARCH against the depth buffer the 3D
-- pass has already filled. Nothing here traces the world: there is no BVH,
-- no voxel octree, no second scene. There is one image of the world and one
-- record of how far away each of its pixels is, and every effect below is a
-- question asked by walking a straight line across that record and reading
-- what it hits. That is the whole trick, and it is why this costs texture
-- fetches rather than geometry -- the scene is drawn exactly once either
-- way.
--
-- Three questions get asked, on a ladder, because they cost very different
-- amounts:
--
--   AO      "how much of the sky can this point actually see?" Eight
--           neighbours in a ring, each one asked whether it stands ABOVE
--           this point's own surface plane. Where many do, the point is in
--           a corner and the sky is boxed out of it -- so the inside of
--           every doorway, the foot of every wall and the gap between two
--           trees darkens, which is the single cheapest thing that makes a
--           diorama read as built out of solid objects rather than assembled
--           from stickers. This is the rung that matters most per
--           millisecond and it is on at every rung above OFF.
--
--   SSR     the water reflects -- the ponds AND the puddles, and the two are
--           not the same surface. See the PUDDLES section below and the note
--           over PUDDLE_AMOUNT: they were sharing one Fresnel curve and one
--           ripple, and both belonged to the pond. A puddle is a film over
--           dark paving with nothing underneath it to look into, so it is
--           nearly all reflection at every camera rung -- and what moves on
--           it is the RAIN landing in it, at the scale of a raindrop, not the
--           sea's swell at the scale of five cells.
--
--           A real reflection off the swell: the ray
--           leaves the surface along the wave's OWN normal -- the analytic
--           one the vertex shader displaced it by, recomputed here from the
--           same two crossing trains -- and is marched across the depth
--           buffer until it lands on something, which is then read out of
--           the colour buffer. So a pond reflects the tree standing beside
--           it, the reflection MOVES with the crest that carries it, and
--           what it reflects is whatever is actually there rather than a
--           painted-in guess. Where the ray runs off the edge of the frame
--           or finds nothing, the sky's own haze fills in -- which is the
--           honest answer, since a ray that leaves the screen going upward
--           left toward the sky.
--
--   SHAFTS  light through the gaps. A march from every pixel TOWARD the
--           sun's disc (the same one the sky already hangs, projected
--           through the same camera), counting how much of that line is
--           open sky. A pixel with a clear run to the sun gets the whole
--           beam; one with a roof in the way gets none, and the boundary
--           between them is a god ray. Only at MAX, because it is a march
--           across the entire frame rather than across the water.
--
-- ------- why this is a separate pass and not more shader in the scene
--
-- Because none of it can be answered while the scene is being drawn. A
-- fragment being shaded knows its own depth and nothing else's; the
-- reflection of a building that has not been rasterised yet is not in any
-- buffer to read. So the scene finishes, and THEN this runs over the
-- finished pair of images -- which is also what makes it free of the draw
-- order entirely: nothing here cares what was submitted when.
--
-- ------- where it sits in the frame
--
-- Inside Voxel3D.endScene, at the resolution the scene was RASTERISED at
-- rather than the one it is presented at. That matters at RES 1/2 or below:
-- running a screen-space pass over an already-upscaled image is paying four
-- times over to march through detail that was never rendered. It also means
-- the battle arena gets all of this for nothing -- it renders through the
-- same beginScene / endScene pair, into a slot of its own, and this follows
-- the slot.
--
-- ------- what it does to the art
--
-- Deliberately little. This is a four-colour world drawn on a pixel grid,
-- and the failure mode of every effect here is the same one: a soft
-- gradient laid over hard-edged art, which reads as dirt. So the AO is
-- weak enough to be a shading of the corner rather than a smudge in it,
-- the reflection is gated behind a Fresnel term that keeps a pond seen from
-- above mostly sky (which is what a pond seen from above is), and the
-- shafts are additive light rather than a fog. The whole ladder is one
-- OPTIONS row with OFF on it, and OFF is byte-identical to the mod without
-- this file -- the scene pass does not even allocate the readable depth
-- buffer.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module
local V = ...

local ModSetting = V.require("ModSetting")
local Device = V.require("Device")
local RenderTarget = V.require("RenderTarget")
-- Held for its numbers and its rung, never the other way round: Anime
-- requires ModSetting and nothing else, so this and Voxel3D can both hold
-- it without either reaching back.
local Anime = V.require("Anime")

local RayFX = {}

-- The ladder, cheapest-useful first. values[1] is ModSetting's default and
-- its fallback for an unreadable stored value.
--
-- ------- WHY THE DEFAULT IS AUTO AND NOT RT
--
-- It used to be RT, on the reasoning that "a graphics setting whose default
-- is none of it is a setting nobody finds".  That reasoning still holds on a
-- desktop and AUTO gives it RT there.  It does not hold on a phone, and this
-- row is the single most expensive thing in the mod on one: RT marches
-- thirteen DEPENDENT depth fetches per pixel through a full-screen pass, and
-- it also forces the scene's depth buffer to be a READABLE canvas, which is
-- the one attachment a tile-based GPU would otherwise never write out to
-- memory at all.  At the old RES 1/2 on a 2712x1220 panel that is 11.6
-- million incoherent fetches and a 3.3 MB depth store, every frame, before
-- the world itself is drawn.  Defaulting a mobile GPU into that is not
-- discoverability, it is a mod that does not run.
--
-- AUTO is one lookup (lib/Device.lua) and nothing else: RT on a desktop GL
-- context, OFF on a tile-based mobile one.  Everything below it in the
-- ladder is unchanged, so a save that says "rt", "ao", "off" or "max" still
-- resolves to itself and the row still cycles the same direction.
--
-- ------- WHY THE ROW IS CALLED SCREEN FX AND NOT RTX
--
-- It was "RTX" for a long time, and the name was a lie by association:
-- nothing here is ray tracing in the sense that word sells -- no hardware
-- RT cores, no bounces against the world's geometry, no light transport.
-- Every effect is a march across the depth buffer the 3D pass already
-- filled, which is screen-space work and nothing else. A player who
-- reads "RTX" and expects the reflections a raytraced game gives is being
-- promised something the row cannot do; a player on a phone who reads
-- "RTX" and switches it off "because my phone has no RTX" is being kept
-- from a row that runs fine there at AO. SCREEN FX says what it is. The
-- stored key stays "rayfx" and the stored values stay the same words, so
-- an old save resolves to the same rung it always did; only the labels
-- the player sees change ("RT" reads as "SSR": screen-space reflections,
-- which is the effect that rung adds).
RayFX.setting = ModSetting.new("rayfx", "SCREEN FX",

-- ------- the dials
--
-- All four are tuned against the art rather than against physics, and all

-- How far the AO ring reaches, as a fraction of the canvas height. A

-- at every RES rung and every window size -- a performance row that also

RayFX.AO_SPAN = 0.020
RayFX.AO_MIN, RayFX.AO_MAX = 3, 14

-- How far away a neighbour can stand and still shade this point, in world
-- pixels. About a cell and a half: the wall you are standing against
-- shades you, the building across the street does not.
RayFX.AO_RANGE = 20

-- And how hard. At 1.6 a right-angle corner lands around 0.78 of its lit
-- value, which is a shading; at 3 it is a stain.
RayFX.AO_POWER = 1.6

-- How much of a mirror the water is at its most reflective (straight-on
-- grazing). Short of 1 because a Gen 1 pond is not a mirror, and because
-- the surface's own art -- the tileset's water tile, which the shader has
-- already sparkled -- is worth keeping visible under the reflection.
RayFX.SSR_AMOUNT = 0.80

-- The shafts' strength at their brightest, and how much more the twilight
-- gets: low sun is when a god ray is a real thing you see, so the glow the
-- sky already computes for dawn and dusk drives this too.
RayFX.SHAFT_AMOUNT = 0.16
RayFX.SHAFT_GLOW = 0.22

RayFX.SHAFT_COLOR = { 0.97, 0.94, 0.78 }

-- ------- which pixels are water, and the two ways that went wrong
--
-- Water is identified GEOMETRICALLY rather than by a flag: it is the only
-- class in the shape profile that stands below zero (see Water.lua), so a
-- reconstructed point below the ceiling below, whose surface faces up, is
-- the water surface. There is no water mask to sample -- the pass runs after
-- the scene and has only the colour and the depth.
--
-- That test was open at BOTH ends, and each was a real bug.
--
-- At the top: the V-CURVE row bends the world down over the horizon by
-- subtracting the square of the distance from the camera's focus (see
-- WorldCurve and the vertex shader). The depth buffer records the BENT
-- world, so `worldAt` hands back a bent point -- and past a certain radius
-- every pixel in the frame stands below the water ceiling. With V-CURVE on,
-- the whole distant world was classified as a pond and reflected. So the
-- curve is undone before the test: the classification asks about the FLAT
-- world, which is the one the shape profile's heights are written in.
--
-- At the bottom: nothing. A point a hundred pixels down was as much "water"
-- as one at -2, so any reconstruction outlier, any geometry a total
-- conversion sinks, and the bent horizon again all qualified. Water lives in
-- a BAND -- recessed to -2, lifted and dropped by the swell -- and the band
-- is what is tested now.
RayFX.WATER_Y = -0.4          -- the ceiling: above this is bank, not water
RayFX.WATER_BASE = -2         -- the class's own recess (TileShape.water)
RayFX.WATER_SLACK = 1.2       -- below the deepest trough, for the floor

-- ------- and the PUDDLES, which are water this pass would never have found
--
-- A puddle is a decal the GROUND row lays on top of the floor (see
-- GroundFX), not a class in the shape profile -- so it stands ABOVE zero and
-- every test above rules it out. It is still water: it is a piece of sky
-- lying on the road, and the one thing a pond does that it did not was
-- reflect.
--
-- For two releases there was nothing to identify it BY except its height:
-- this pass gets the colour buffer and the depth buffer and no third thing,
-- and a mask, a stencil or a water channel each read as a whole extra render
-- target on a build whose argument is that it runs on a phone. The height
-- was tried absolute (worked on Route 1, missed raised town paving), then as
-- a FRACTION (0.7 is a puddle at any height, and no class in the shape
-- profile stands at a fraction). The fraction is what the probe took apart:
-- a character card leans back by the camera's pitch and its height crosses
-- 0.7 a dozen times up the player's own face. See PUDDLE_AMOUNT for the
-- three gates that failed and why a fourth was not attempted.
--
-- What it took was noticing that the third thing was already there. The
-- colour buffer has an ALPHA channel; the void uses it and no drawn pixel
-- does, because the alpha blend saturates every one of them to exactly 1.0.
-- So the ground row stamps its decals into it in a second masked draw, at no
-- extra target and no extra fetch, and a puddle is finally a thing this pass
-- KNOWS rather than infers. The argument in full is over
-- Voxel3D.beginAlphaStamp; what lands here is one comparison.
--
-- The two files hold the same constant and must agree; neither can require
-- the other, so it is written down twice with a note in both -- the same way
-- the decal's float height is written in GroundFX.PUDDLE.
--
-- Voxel3D.PUDDLE_TAG is this same number in the file that writes it, and the
-- probes check that the two agree.
RayFX.PUDDLE_TAG = 254 / 255
-- How far off it a byte may land and still count. TIGHT on purpose, and the
-- number is not a tolerance for noise -- there is none to tolerate. The
-- channel is 8-bit unorm and the value arrives back as exactly 254/255, so
-- the only thing this has to do is stay clear of the neighbouring step:
-- geometry is at 255/255, which is 0.0039 away. Half a step is 0.002, and
-- anything looser would classify the entire world as standing water.
RayFX.PUDDLE_TAG_W = 0.002

-- A puddle is an inch deep and a pond is not, so it takes only a share of
-- the swell's tilt -- enough that the reflection breathes with the rain
-- landing in it, not enough to look like surf in a pothole.
RayFX.PUDDLE_RIPPLE = 0.35

-- ------- and how much of a MIRROR a puddle is, which is where this went
-- wrong and why the row looked like it did nothing
--
-- A pond and a puddle were sharing one Fresnel curve, and they must not.
--
-- The curve is `mix(0.10, 1.0, (1 - cos)^3)` -- almost nothing seen from
-- above, a full mirror seen along the surface -- and for a POND that is
-- right: a pond has a body. There is water under the surface, it has a
-- colour, and looking down into it you see the water rather than the sky. So
-- the reflection is allowed to be a tenth of the pixel at a steep camera.
--
-- A puddle has no body. It is a film over dark paving, and there is nothing
-- underneath it to see: what a wet street shows you IS the reflection, at
-- every angle you can stand at. Running it through the pond's curve gave it
-- the tenth, and then GroundFX composited that tenth under a decal drawn at
-- 90% alpha in a dark sky tint -- so the "reflection" landed at about a
-- twelfth of the final pixel and the feature was, correctly, invisible.
--
-- Worked through at the four camera rungs, the old numbers were:
--
--   15 deg  f*ssr = 0.080      35 deg  0.084
--   50 deg  0.113              75 deg  0.373
--
-- Only the 75-degree rung -- the one nobody plays at -- ever showed it. The
-- floor below is what makes a puddle read as standing water at 15 and 35,
-- which is where the camera actually is. The same four rungs, with it:
--
--   15 deg  0.595            35 deg  0.597
--   50 deg  0.612            75 deg  0.744
--
-- Nearly flat across the ladder, which is the point: the reflection is what
-- the surface IS, so it should not appear as the player tips the camera. It
-- still opens up at 75 because a grazing view of any water reflects more,
-- and the pond's curve is left exactly as it was.
--
-- Not taken to 1. The decal underneath is painted in the sky's own hue at
-- PUDDLE_TONE, and that dark blue showing through the reflection is what
-- says the reflection is IN something -- a pool at a flat 1.0 is a hole in
-- the road with a building in it.
-- ------- AND WHY THEY SPENT A RELEASE AT THE POND'S NUMBERS
--
-- Everything above is a correct description of what a puddle should reflect,
-- and it shipped switched OFF -- both values set to the pond's -- because
-- the pass could not tell a puddle from a person, and these two numbers are
-- what decided whether that mattered.
--
-- The identifier was the FRACTION of the height: a pool floats 0.7 above
-- whatever ground it lies on, and no class in the shape profile stands at a
-- fraction. The probe took it apart. A CHARACTER is a card leaned back by
-- exactly the camera's pitch, so its world height climbs its own face and
-- crosses point-seven a dozen times on the way up; its normal is aimed at
-- the camera, so it passed the faces-up test at every rung. The player,
-- every NPC, every wild and street Pokemon and the carved rim of every hedge
-- were being classified as standing water -- and at the tenth of a pixel the
-- pond's curve gives them, which is where this sat since the row shipped,
-- nobody could see it. Raising a puddle to the strength it should have was
-- therefore not a tuning change, it was what made a latent bug visible: at
-- 0.6 the player mirrored the sky in horizontal stripes.
--
-- Two gates were tried against the probe and both failed. They are kept here
-- because they rule out a whole family of fixes:
--
--   FLATNESS (four depth taps, reject a surface whose neighbours sit off its
--   plane) has no discriminating power at high render resolution -- a screen
--   texel there covers a fraction of a world pixel, so every surface is
--   locally flat. Tightened until it rejected the player, it rejected the
--   puddles too.
--
--   A STRICT NORMAL (N.y > 0.98) is resolution-independent and does reject
--   the cards, but the puddles only pass it at the near-top-down rung: at 35
--   and 75 degrees not one pool qualified. Which also exposed the larger
--   problem -- at those rungs the pools were not passing the FRACTION test
--   either, so the identifier had never worked there at all.
--
-- ------- AND WHAT REPLACED IT: THE MARK
--
-- Not a third guess at geometry. The ground row now STAMPS its puddle decals
-- into the alpha channel of this very buffer, in a second draw of the same
-- meshes with the colour write masked down to alpha alone -- so the question
-- "is this pixel a puddle" is answered by the pixel itself, exactly, at the
-- cost of no fetch at all (`src` is read on the first line of effect for its
-- colour). No render target was added, no attribute, no remesh: the channel
-- was already there and already meaningful, and every ordinary draw
-- SATURATES it to 1.0, so nothing can land on the mark by accident. The full
-- argument is over Voxel3D.beginAlphaStamp.
--
-- Which is why the two numbers below are the ones the table above describes
-- rather than the pond's. The player is not classified as water at any rung,
-- so a puddle may finally reflect like one.
RayFX.PUDDLE_AMOUNT = 0.92
RayFX.PUDDLE_FRESNEL = 0.46
-- ------- and the mirror is DARKER than what it reflects
--
-- With the floor above and the amount at nearly one, a pool under an
-- overcast sky came out AS the sky: the same pale grey, edge to edge, and
-- a wet plaza read as a sheet of snow. That is the "burst" the puddles
-- were reported for. A film over dark paving is not a silvered mirror --
-- at the angles this camera stands at it hands back well under all of
-- the light that falls on it, and what the eye uses to tell standing
-- water from the sky above it is exactly that the water is the sky, but
-- DARKER. So a pool's reflection is scaled by this before it is mixed
-- in, and a pond's is left alone: a pond has a body and its own curve.
RayFX.PUDDLE_DIM = 0.62

-- Paint the puddle classification instead of reflecting with it: every pixel
-- the pass calls a pool comes out flat magenta. OFF in every build a player
-- runs, and the only thing that turns it on is a probe.
--
-- It exists because the honest test of a mask cannot be a before/after pair.
-- Two shots of a rain shower are two different frames of an animation, so a
-- pixel diff between them is contaminated by every ripple and every falling
-- drop -- the last session lost itself in exactly that. Where the colour
-- LANDS is a single-frame question with a single-frame answer.
RayFX.DEBUG_MASK = false

-- ------- what the rain does to the surface it is landing in
--
-- The old ripple was the SEA's swell, taken at a third. That is the wrong
-- shape twice over and it is the whole of "it does not react".
--
-- Wrong in SCALE: the swell's two trains have wavelengths around eighty
-- world pixels, which is five cells. A puddle is one or two cells across, so
-- the whole pool sat inside a fraction of one wave and tilted as a single
-- plane -- the reflection slid about as a slab instead of breaking up.
--
-- Wrong in CAUSE: `Water.swell()` is the WATER row, and the row's first rung
-- is FLAT. A player who does not want the sea to heave was also switching
-- off every ripple in every puddle in Kanto, in a downpour, which is not
-- what that row promises. And on the maps this matters most on -- a town,
-- which has no water in it at all -- the swell is whatever the row says and
-- has nothing to do with the shower overhead.
--
-- So the puddle gets its own surface, off `Water.rain()` (which is the
-- shower, clamped) rather than off the swell:
--
--   CHOP   two crossing trains at about five world pixels, which is the
--          scale of the scatter rain leaves on standing water. This is what
--          turns a mirror into a wet mirror.
--   RINGS  one impact per cell on its own clock, expanding and dying -- the
--          thing you actually watch a puddle for. Radially symmetric, so the
--          slope points out of the impact, which is what makes a ring read
--          as a ring rather than as a bright circle.
--
-- Both die to nothing as the shower does, so the pool goes glassy still in
-- the ten minutes of aftermath GroundFX keeps it around for -- and a still
-- puddle reflecting a sharp roofline is the shot this whole row is for.
-- Both AMPLITUDES are wave HEIGHTS in world pixels, not slopes -- the shader
-- multiplies each by its own frequency to get the slope, because that is
-- what the derivative of a sine is. Worth writing down because the numbers
-- look far too small otherwise: a puddle's ripple is a fraction of one world
-- pixel deep, and the slope is what you see.
--
--   chop  0.09 x 1.25, twice over  ->  about a tenth, near 10 degrees of
--         tilt. A shimmer. Taken to the four tenths it started at, the
--         normal swung nearly forty degrees and the reflection came apart
--         into noise -- which is a puddle in a hurricane, not in rain.
--   ring  0.55 x 0.62  ->  about a third, near 19 degrees at the crest. A
--         ring is a SHAPE and is meant to be seen; the chop is a texture and
--         is not.
--
-- The REACH is under a cell on purpose. Each cell computes only its OWN
-- impact -- one hash and one sine per pixel, which is what keeps this
-- affordable on a phone -- so a ring that travelled further than its cell
-- would be clipped square at the cell boundary. Six and a half pixels from a
-- centre kept to the middle of the cell stays inside it, and at four rings
-- across a full-size pool that is the right scale anyway.
