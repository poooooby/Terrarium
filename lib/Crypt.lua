-- Voxel world mode: the AIR of the tower of graves -- what the crypt is lit
-- by, what it is filled with, and which of its floors are restless.
--
-- lib/CryptKit.lua stands the Pokemon Tower's floors as a crypt: the ring of
-- wall panels the drawing spells as a chamber cut into grey stock becomes a
-- tall octagon of ashlar that climbs out of the light, the mass beyond it
-- goes to black, the headstones stand on plinths. Geometry is not what
-- makes a room read as a crypt, though -- light is. A Gen 1 interior is lit
-- flat, every surface the same white, and under that a stone wall is a grey
-- rectangle. So this module is the other half of the same idea, the half
-- that runs every frame:
--
--   AMBIENT   the tint is held DOWN and cooled (the passage's lesson, see
--             lib/Underpass.lua: there was never too little light indoors,
--             there was too little dark), lowest on the haunted floors.
--   LAMPS     candle lanterns in wall sconces -- the scene shader's eight
--             point lights, warm, breathing on the gas clock -- so the
--             stone is bright under a flame and gloomy between them. Their
--             SITES are authored here per floor, and the kit reads the same
--             table to put the iron bracket and the lantern on the wall,
--             so a pool of light always has a flame over it.
--   FLAMES    the flame itself, a flattened card at each lantern (the
--             street lamp's own trick: a drawn thing the hour's tint cannot
--             put out), with a halo, flickering.
--   AIR       a violet haze on the haunted floors (data/atmosphere.lua,
--             entries marked `indoor`), so the far wall greys out and the
--             room has depth. lib/GhostFX.lua reads `haunted` to let its
--             wisps breathe out of the graves.
