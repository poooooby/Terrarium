-- What the weather LEAVES BEHIND: puddles after the rain, and the clock the
-- snow settles and melts on.
--
-- The WEATHER row draws what is falling. This draws what has fallen. They
-- are two different features and the difference is time: a shower is over in
-- two minutes and the ground it soaked is wet for ten, which is most of the
-- time a player spends walking around in the aftermath of one. Without this
-- the sky clears and Kanto is instantly, impossibly dry -- the effect
-- switching off rather than the weather ending.
--
-- ------- the two numbers
--
-- `wet` and `cover`, both 0..1, both slow. Rain drives the first up over
-- about a minute of downpour and it drains away over four; snow drives the
-- second and it melts over seven. Everything below is a function of one of
-- those two, exactly as everything a shower does is a function of
-- Weather.power -- because that is what makes an aftermath read as an
-- aftermath rather than as a second effect that also switched on.
--
-- They accumulate off `Weather.falling`, NOT `Weather.visible`, and that is
-- the same distinction that file draws for its own sound: `falling` is what
-- the weather is doing in KANTO, and walking into a house does not stop the
-- route outside getting wet. `visible` is what may be DRAWN here, and it is
-- what the draw below gates on -- so a cave floor is never wet and a room
-- never has snow in it, while the route you came in from keeps soaking.
--
-- ------- these are DECALS, not overlay drawings
--
-- Every other drawing this mod composites -- the ambient life, the steam,
-- the glint, the rain's own splashes -- goes into the overlay pass, which
-- runs after the 3D scene is finished and therefore paints over everything
-- in it. That is right for a butterfly and wrong for a puddle: a butterfly
-- IS in front of the world, and a puddle is underneath the person standing
-- in it. An overlay puddle would be painted over the player's feet, which
-- is not a puddle, it is a sticker.
--
-- So these go into the 3D pass itself, between the terrain and the
-- characters, on the same decal footing the flat drop shadows use:
-- depth-TESTED, so a puddle behind the Mart stays behind the Mart, and never
-- depth-WRITING, so the tall grass drawn at the end of the frame still wins
-- its feet-overdraw fights. Which also means they take the hour's light and
-- the sun's own shadows for free -- they are geometry in the scene, so the
-- same shader that darkens a roof at dusk darkens them.
--
-- The price of that footing is that they want the VOXEL camera, exactly as
-- the steam and the Zs do: the flat 2D path has no depth buffer, no camera
-- to project through and no pass to sit between.
--
-- ------- where a puddle goes, and why it is not a die
--
-- Hashed off the cell, like the sleeping Meowth and for the same reason: a
-- random roll would put the puddles somewhere else every time the map
-- streamed back in, and water that teleports between paving stones is not
-- weather, it is a particle system. Hashed, the yard outside the Pewter gym
-- has a puddle in the same corner every time it rains, forever, which is
-- what a low spot IS.
--
-- Baked into one mesh per 16-cell chunk and cached per map, for the reason
-- the terrain is: the SET of puddles on a map never changes, only how full
-- they are, so walking should cost a matrix and a colour rather than a
-- rebuild. What varies per frame is one alpha and one colour -- and the
-- colour is the SKY's, because a puddle is a piece of the sky lying on the
-- ground, and a puddle at sunset that stayed grey would be the one thing on
-- screen not taking part in the evening.
--
-- ------- and the snow is NOT drawn here any more
--
-- Only its clock is. `cover` climbs through a fall and melts off after,
-- and everything the snow LOOKS like -- the cover on every up-face, the
-- drifts, the trench a walker leaves and the prints along it, the depth
-- everybody stands in -- is the scene shader's, fed by lib/SnowField.lua
-- (the deformation field) and by snowTint / snowDepth below (how deep it
-- lies). The decals this file used to lay for it -- three drawings of
-- drift, three of crust, a footprint sticker -- read as a white floor with
-- mould on it, and they are gone. What is still a decal here is a WET
-- print: the dark mark a boot leaves stepping out of a puddle onto dry
-- paving, which is water and not snow.

--
-- Drop a strip of 16x16 frames at `assets/ground/puddle.png`,

-- it is used as-is, nothing is generated, and however many frames the strip
-- is wide is however many variants there are. That is the same contract the
-- roamers' own art already has (assets/roamers/<SPECIES>.png), and for the
-- same reason: a drawn puddle beats a described one, and nobody should have
-- to read a Lua file to replace a picture.
--
-- The generated shapes below are the FALLBACK -- what the mod looks like out
-- of the box, because a mod that shipped a feature and a note saying "now
-- draw five PNGs" has not shipped the feature.
--
-- Two rules any replacement has to keep, both of them the scene shader's
-- rather than this file's:
--
--   the ALPHA is the shape.  Anything under half alpha is DISCARDED, not
--   blended -- that is how a sprite cuts its own silhouette out of its quad
--   in this mode -- so a soft airbrushed edge does not fade, it vanishes at
--   the halfway line. Draw hard edges, and dither if you want a fringe.
--
--   the RGB is a TONE, not a colour.  Every texel is multiplied by the
--   colour this file picks -- the sky's own hue for a puddle, white for
--   snow -- so a strip drawn in greys lands in the right colour at every
--   hour of the day, and one drawn in blue comes out blue TIMES blue at

-- ------- bare earth: what is under the grass that is no longer there
--
-- Two halves in one strip. Frames 0..VARIANTS-1 are TRODDEN DIRT and

-- the cause already stored in the wear field and neither needs its own
-- layer, its own mesh or its own draw.
--
-- The edge is FEATHERED and that is the whole difference between a path and
-- a sticker. A hard-edged brown shape on green grass reads as a decal no
-- matter how good the shape is; earth showing between thinning tufts has no
-- outline at all, because what bounds it is the grass, not the dirt. So the
-- alpha ramps out over the last couple of pixels and the body darkens as it
-- goes, which is also what real trodden ground does -- the middle is packed
-- and pale, the rim is still shaded by what is left standing over it.
-- ------- and the dirt is WARM and fairly LIGHT, which took a screenshot
--
-- The first values here were a mid brown body (0.44) over a much darker rim
-- (0.28), on the reasoning that a rim wants contrast -- which is right for a
-- hole in a white surface (the old snow prints) and wrong
-- for this. A patch of earth is not a hole in the grass; it is a surface in
-- its own right, lit by the same sun. Rendered, those values read as
-- near-black spots scattered through the meadow: the shape was right and it
-- looked like damage rather than like a trodden path.
--
-- So the body is dry sunlit earth, the rim is only a little darker than it

-- outline), and the grit barely separates from the body -- it is texture,

-- ------- how many, how big, and the three steps it gets there in
--
-- The SIZE grows in three steps as the weather works, and the steps are the
-- point rather than a compromise. A pool that swelled smoothly would want a
-- rebuilt mesh every frame; three baked sizes cost three meshes per chunk,
-- built once, of which exactly ONE is ever drawn. And on a world made of
-- voxels the right way for a puddle to grow is a pixel at a time anyway --
-- the same reason nothing else in this mod tweens.
--
-- ------- puddles: FEW and BIG, and spaced
--
-- A share-of-cells density was the wrong tool for water and it looked it: at
-- one cell in six, small pools landed next to each other in twos and threes
-- and a wet street came out stippled, which is not what rain does. Rain
-- collects: a few wide shallow pools with dry ground between them, because
-- the low spot next to a low spot is one low spot.
--
-- So a puddle cell has to WIN its neighbourhood -- it is placed only where
-- its own hash is the lowest of every candidate within SPACING cells. That
-- is a Poisson-disc thinning done with arithmetic instead of a die: stable
-- across sessions like everything else here, needing no list of what was
-- placed, and guaranteeing by construction that no two pools are closer than
-- the spacing. The candidate density is generous precisely because the
-- thinning is what decides the count.
--
-- And then they are WIDE -- a pool at its fullest is a cell and a half
-- across, which is what a puddle in the references looks like: something you
-- would walk around, not a spot.
--
-- (The snow used to be a third layer here, everywhere and thickening. It
-- is the scene shader's now -- see the header -- and STEPS is the pools'
-- and the worn patches' alone.)
GroundFX.STEPS = 3

-- Puddles: the pool of candidates, and the neighbourhood a candidate has to
-- win to become one.
--
-- The neighbourhood sets the count, and it was measured rather than reasoned
-- about, because reasoning about it was wrong twice. A local-minimum rule
-- leaves roughly one winner per neighbourhood, so the arithmetic says a
-- radius of 3 gives one pool per forty-nine cells; what the probe counted
-- was one per a hundred and forty-four, because most of a town is buildings
-- and hedges and only a third of it is ground a pool may lie on. A street in
-- a downpour had four.
--
-- So: the eight neighbours, and nothing further. One pool per nine eligible
-- cells, and two winners can never touch -- the nearest a pair can be is two
-- cells, which at the size below leaves a hand's width of dry ground between
-- them. Sparse enough to read as rain collecting, close enough that a wet
-- street looks wet.

-- ------- and what a CANOPY keeps off the ground under it

-- thing to get wet and the first to show through the snow. That is the
-- shape of shelter people actually notice: standing under a tree in a
-- shower, and the ring of bare grass under one after a snowfall.
--
-- Both read GrassWear.canopyAt -- the alpha channel Trees3D bakes when the
-- map binds, off where the crowns really landed rather than off the site
-- grid (the jitter and the per-site scale make those different maps).

-- this much cover the ground under a crown simply stays dry.

-- ------- does this cell hold a pool?
--
-- Asked here rather than inside the mesh builder because it is the whole of
-- how a wet street READS, and a claim about how a wet street reads should be
-- checkable as a table of coordinates rather than only as a screenshot (see
-- GroundFX.puddleCells, which the probe walks).
--
-- A BLOCK GRID, and it is the third rule this has had -- the first two were
-- both attempts to thin a per-cell die down to something spaced, and both
-- were unpredictable in the same way. A local-minimum-of-the-hash rule is a
-- Poisson-disc thinning and reads beautifully on paper; what it actually
-- produced was one pool per a hundred and forty-four cells where the
-- arithmetic promised one per forty-nine, because the estimate assumes every
-- neighbour is eligible and most of a town is buildings. Tightening the
-- radius from three to one moved it from four pools to five. A rule whose
-- output cannot be predicted from its input is a rule that gets tuned by
-- screenshot forever.
--
-- So the map is cut into BLOCKS of PUDDLE_BLOCK cells square, and each block
-- holds at most one pool: the hash decides whether that block gets one at
-- all, and then which of its cells -- walking the block in a hash-rotated
-- order and taking the first that can actually hold water, so a block whose
-- middle is a building still gets its pool on the pavement beside it.
--
-- What that buys is a count you can state: one pool per PUDDLE_BLOCK squared
-- cells, times PUDDLE_FILL, and never two in the same block. At three cells
-- and four fifths that is a pool every eleven cells of ground -- which is
-- what a wet street looks like -- and the arithmetic and the probe agree.
