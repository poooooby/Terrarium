-- standing under something rather than floating on a black plate.
--
-- What is up there differs by rung, and the sky follows it rather than being
-- retuned for each. At 75 degrees the camera is pitched far enough over that
-- the horizon is genuinely in frame, and the bands run down to meet it. At the
-- steeper rungs the horizon is above the top edge and the void that shows is
-- where the ground runs OUT -- past the map edge, past the curve -- so the
-- bands take a fixed slice of the frame instead (lib/Sky.lua, Sky.SPAN) and the
-- haze below them fills the rest.
--
-- INDOORS THERE IS NO SKY. A house, a cave or a gym is a room with a
-- ceiling, and the void past its walls is the outside of a box, not open
-- air. Map.isOutdoor is the same test the engine uses for door SFX and the
-- town map, and the same one Structures already asks to decide whether a
-- map rings with trees.
--
-- The colour is a four-shade ramp shaped like a world palette so the

-- ------- WHICH WAY A CARD HAS TO TURN
--
-- A character is a flat card standing on its cell, and for the whole life
-- of this mod it faced due SOUTH and only leaned: the free-roam camera has
-- no yaw, it is always parked to the south looking north, so a card that
-- faces south faces the camera by construction. That is what the note on
-- YAW above means by "the character cards themselves never yaw".
--
-- The moment a camera CAN turn -- lib/MarioCam.lua's orbit, a quarter
-- turn per key press -- that stops being true and
-- the failure is spectacular rather than subtle: the card keeps facing
-- south while the camera looks east, so it is seen edge-on and the
-- character reads as LYING FLAT ON THE GROUND at an angle. Not a wrong
-- angle. A person on the floor.
--
-- So the card turns to face the eye first and leans afterwards. This is
-- the angle it turns by: the bearing from the point the camera looks at to
-- the camera itself, measured so that 0 is due south (+Z here -- a
-- character at rest faces +Z, see the note at the top of Voxel3D).
--
-- Taken from Voxel3D.eye and Voxel3D.focus rather than from MarioCam,
-- because those two are set by WHICHEVER camera drew this frame -- the
-- orbit, the SM64 rig, or a staged battle's placed camera. The orbit puts
-- its eye due south of its focus, so it answers exactly 0 and multiplies
-- in as an identity: the mode everyone is already playing gets the same

-- ------- what is worth submitting
--
-- The world XZ box a pass has to cover, as {x0, z0, x1, z1} in world
-- pixels. Terrain chunks outside it are not drawn (ChunkMesher's cells,
-- Voxel3D.drawGroup's test), and a connected neighbour whose whole body
-- falls outside it costs nothing at all -- which is most of them most of
-- the time, because a map is only ever connected on the side you are not
-- looking at.
--
-- Deliberately generous on all four sides. Every term here is a bound on
-- something the camera might see, and being wrong about that is a hole in
-- the world where being wrong the other way is a few thousand wasted
-- triangles.
--
--   NORTH   how far the camera still sees ground (ShadowMap.groundReach --
--           the same answer the light frustum is fitted to), but taken
--           against a cap twice as far out. The sun pass can let the far
--           field go because its shader fades those shadows out anyway;
--           terrain that stops has an edge on it. At the steep rungs the
--           horizon is genuinely in frame and this reaches past any map.
--           A tall thing standing on ground just past this still shows
--           above it -- that is handled at the draw, per chunk, out of the
--           height each one actually reaches rather than out of the
--           tallest one that could exist anywhere.
--   SIDES   the view widens with distance, so the far ground spans more
--           than the near ground does; half the depth is the same
--           serviceable stand-in ShadowMap.fit uses for the true spread.
--   SOUTH   the camera sits south of its focus, so a little behind.
--
-- `forSun` adds the caster margin on the two sides shadows come FROM. The
-- sun hangs southeast, so what casts onto visible ground stands south and
-- east of it -- the same asymmetry, and the same two sides, as fit().
VoxelScene.FAR_CAP = 5      -- multiples of the view height; ShadowMap's own is 2.5

-- { cx, cy, vw, vh } as of the last render -- see where it is written.
VoxelScene.lastView = { 0, 0, 160, 144 }

-- ------- AND WHEN THE CAMERA HAS A YAW
--
-- Every term above says "north" because the free-roam orbit has no yaw:
-- it looks north, from the south, always. lib/MarioCam.lua breaks that --
-- its orbit turns a quarter at a time round the player -- and a box
-- that still reaches north while the camera looks west is a box that culls
-- most of what is on screen. Holes in the world, in a straight line down
-- the middle of the frame.
--
-- So the box is built in the CAMERA'S frame and then squared off: the same
-- trapezium as before -- a little behind, `north` in front, widening with
-- distance -- laid along wherever the camera happens to point, and the
-- axis-aligned box around that is what gets returned. At yaw zero the four
-- corners land exactly where the four expressions above put them, so the
-- orbit's behaviour is not merely preserved, it is the same arithmetic.
--
-- The sun margin does NOT rotate with it. The sun hangs southeast whatever
-- the camera does, so what casts onto visible ground still stands south
-- and east of it, and that stays an addition on two fixed sides.

    -- the ground around it had been culled while a chunk with something
    -- tall on it survived on the ymax rule.

    -- vertex shader, so ground past that ray can still be in frame, and
    -- FAR_CAP is set to twice the shadow pass's cap precisely to be
    -- generous about it. That generosity was tuned against the orbit.

-- street lamps and the authored trees -- and they were being submitted for
-- the current map AND for every connected neighbour, in the scene pass and
-- again in the sun pass, with no box at all.  A town has up to four
-- neighbours; a forest map's tree mesh is hundreds of thousands of vertices.
-- On a tiler every one of those vertices is written out to main memory
-- during binning whether or not a single triangle survives the clip, so
-- "the GPU throws them away" is not the same as free.
--
-- Chunking those four is the real fix and it is a bigger change than this
-- one.  What is free today is the MAP level: a neighbour is connected on one
-- side, the camera looks one way, and most of the time the neighbour is
-- entirely behind you.  This answers exactly that, and answers `true`
-- whenever it cannot tell -- an unculled draw is a frame cost, a wrongly
-- culled one is a hole in the world.
--
-- The north side carries slack for the same reason drawGroup adds a chunk's
-- ymax to its south edge: the camera looks north and down, so something
-- standing past the far edge still projects into the sky above the horizon.

  -- ------- WHY THIS IS STILL THE CAMERA'S BOX AND NOT THE LIGHT'S
  --
  -- ShadowMap.box (published by fit) is the light frustum's world FOOTPRINT,
  -- and culling casters against it looks obviously right: nothing outside
  -- the frustum can put a texel in the map.  It was tried, and it is wrong.
  --
  -- The ortho volume is fitted in LIGHT space -- fit projects the eight
  -- corners of the world AABB through the light view and takes their extent
  -- -- so the volume it ends up with is SHEARED, and reaches further in
  -- world x/z at some heights than the AABB it was derived from.  A tall
  -- caster whose foot is outside xs/zs can therefore still project into the
  -- map.  Measured, not reasoned: swapping this line moved 4.0% of the
  -- pixels on ROUTE_1 against a 0.0% run-to-run noise floor, and the diff
  -- was tree shadows going missing (tests/visual_ab_probe.lua).
  --
  -- The camera box is generous on purpose (VoxelScene.FAR_CAP is twice the
  -- scene's reach) and that generosity is what makes it safe here.  The
  -- honest tightening is to fit the box to the sheared volume rather than to
  -- the AABB, which is a change with a correctness proof behind it and not a
  -- swap of one box for another.
