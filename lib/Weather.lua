-- Voxel world mode: weather.
--
-- Kanto has one sky and it never changes. This gives it showers -- rain that
-- arrives, falls for a minute or two and clears again -- and snow through the
-- winter of the clock on the wall.
--
-- ------- what a shower actually is here
--
-- Not a particle system bolted over the frame. Five things move together, and
-- the point is that they are the SAME number:
--
--   the sky      loses its colour toward a flat stratus grey, band by band,
--                so the gradient survives and an overcast horizon is still
--                paler than an overcast zenith (DayNight.overcast)
--   the light    drops and goes cool, on the same blend, on the diorama AND
--                on the flat 2D world -- one tint, two worlds, because the
--                clock already solved that problem (DayNight.tint, DayTint)
--   the sun      loses its twilight halo: a sunset behind a rain front has no
--                gold in it (DayNight.glow)
--   the water    loses its glint and gains chop -- rain breaks every crest
--                into a thousand small ones pointing everywhere, so the one
--                clean toon highlight becomes nothing (Water.wet)
--   the air      fills with rain, drawn in two registers at once (below)
--
-- One value, `power`, eased from 0 to its peak over a handful of seconds,
-- drives every one of them. That is why a shower reads as weather rather than
-- as an effect being switched on: the world darkens at exactly the rate the
-- rain thickens, because they are the same ramp.
--
-- ------- the three registers
--
-- Rain is drawn three times, and it has to be.
--
--   SHAFTS   are WORLD-SPACE: a drop with an (x, y, z) that falls through
--            the diorama and STOPS on whatever is under it -- the street,
--            a puddle, a pond, a roof. Projected through the same camera
--            as the splashes. This is the rain you can walk through, the
--            one that hits the Mart and then drips off the eave. A 2D
--            cloth over the frame cannot do any of that.
--
--   STREAKS  are SCREEN-SPACE, and now they are only the air BETWEEN the
--            camera and the near edge of the diorama -- a thin mist, not
--            the shower. Rain that close has no world position, and
--            giving it one puts it behind the trees. Kept few and dim so
--            they do not read as a sheet taped to the lens.
--
--   SPLASHES are WORLD-SPACE: cel rings that open where a shaft actually
--            landed. Water gets a crown, a roof a tick and a drip, dry
--            stone a small ring. They are what says the rain is landing
--            on THIS world rather than on the glass.
--
-- Snow is world-space only, and slower: a flake has a position in the
-- diorama, drifts down through it and lands, which is the whole reason snow
-- looks like snow. Screen-space snow is dandruff.
--
-- ------- when it snows
--
-- In the winter of the machine's own calendar, which is the same clock the
-- DAYTIME row's SYNC rung follows -- Kanto's evening falls when yours does,
-- so Kanto's winter is yours as well. See HEMISPHERE: it is one word, and it
-- is the only thing in this file that cannot be derived.
--
-- ------- and where it does not happen
--
-- Indoors, and under a canopy. A room has no sky to rain out of -- the same
-- test the sky, the sun and the hour's tint already rest on -- and Viridian
-- Forest's roof of leaves is why that map is a canopy in the first place.
-- The SOUND goes on indoors (lib/AmbientSound), because that is what a roof
-- is for.

-- Not `V.require`d at the top with the others, and the reason is a cycle:
-- Voxel3D's own header describes the order it has to be loaded in, and a
-- weather file dragging the renderer in at load time is not the place to
-- discover the rest of it. Memoised, so the pcall happens once.
--
-- Declared HERE, above everything, and that is not tidiness either. It
-- first lived down beside the rain shader -- four hundred lines BELOW
-- Weather.update, which calls it. Inside update the name was therefore a
-- global, the global was nil, and calling it threw on every single frame:
-- the tick never ran, and a probe found the shower with zero shafts and
-- zero splashes in it. A silent, total failure of the weather system,
-- caused by a local declared too far down the file.

-- it, because the leaves are the roof that map is named for.
--
-- Declared HERE, above its callers, rather than beside the tick that first
-- needed it: a Lua closure captures the locals in scope where it is written,
-- so a `local function` further down the file is a nil global to everything
-- above it -- silently, until the first call.

-- below drops every splash and every streak the moment the sky closes over,
-- but the DRAW re-filled the streak field from scratch on the very next frame

-- falling through the ceiling of every house you walked into. Clearing the

--
-- What rain actually does to dry ground is DARKEN it where it lands, and
-- what this art style does with darkness is draw it as ink -- the same
-- lesson the battle overlay already paid for: on a bright ground you draw

-- ------- A DROP HAS A SIZE, AND EVERYTHING ELSE IS A CONSEQUENCE
--
-- What was here gave every shaft its fall speed, its length, its width and
-- its brightness from the depth LAYER it was sorted into -- three buckets,
-- three sets of constants. That is a fine way to fake distance and a poor
-- way to make water, because in the world none of those four numbers is
-- free: they are all downstream of one thing, how big the drop is.
--
-- Rain is not one drop size. A shower is a whole distribution of them,
-- mostly fine with a scatter of fat ones, and the visible texture of rain
-- IS that distribution -- the few heavy drops falling fast and near
-- vertical, the haze of fine ones drifting sideways behind them. Sorting a
-- field into three fixed speeds cannot produce it: you get three combs.
--
-- So a shaft rolls a SIZE, and:
--
--   its SPEED is the terminal velocity of that size, on the curve below
--   its LEAN is not set at all -- it falls out of the speed (see stepShafts)
--   its LENGTH is how far it travels while the eye integrates, i.e. speed
--   its WEIGHT on screen -- width and brightness -- is the size again
--
-- Which means one roll, and the field sorts ITSELF into what reads as
-- depth without anybody assigning depth.
--
-- Biased toward the fine end: the exponent is what stops the roll from
-- being a uniform spread of sizes, which real rain never is (Marshall and
-- Palmer measured an exponential, and the far tail is where the fat drops
-- live). A flat roll gives a shower made half of heavy drops, which reads
-- as hail.
-- ------- and the four rains
--
-- The size distribution is not a constant, it is a function of how hard it
-- is raining -- so these come in pairs: what the roll looks like at the
-- faint edge of a shower, and what it looks like at the peak of one.
--
--   DRIZZLE     a hard small bias and a low floor. Almost nothing but fine
--               rain, falling slowly, leaning a long way in any wind.
--   CLOUDBURST  a nearly flat roll off a raised floor. The fat drops
--               arrive, fall fast, lean hardly at all, and land heavily.
--
-- Everything downstream -- speed, streak length, width, brightness, how
-- big a crown it throws, how much it is pushed by a gust -- already comes
-- out of the size, so moving the distribution moves the whole character of
-- the weather and nothing has to be told about it twice.
Weather.DROP_MIN = 0.10
Weather.DROP_MIN_WET = 0.26
Weather.DROP_MAX = 1.00
Weather.DROP_BIAS = 2.7           -- drizzle: >1 rolls small, fat drops rare
Weather.DROP_BIAS_WET = 1.15      -- cloudburst: nearly a flat roll
-- Filled once a frame by the tick from the shower's own power, so a
-- spawning drop does not have to go and ask.
Weather.dropPower = 1

-- ------- terminal velocity, in miniature
--
-- The real curve (Gunn and Kinzer) rises steeply for fine drops and then
-- flattens: drag grows with the SQUARE of the radius while weight grows
-- with the CUBE, so a drop twice as wide is nowhere near twice as fast,
-- and past about four millimetres it stops gaining at all. That shape is
-- the whole point. A linear size-to-speed map -- which is what "big drops
-- fall faster" turns into if you write it straight -- gives a field whose
-- fastest drop is six times its slowest, and that does not look like rain,
-- it looks like a screensaver.
--
-- Returned as a MULTIPLIER on Weather.SHAFT_FALL so the shower's overall
-- pace stays one number a person can turn.
-- Scaled so the AVERAGE drop in the roll above falls at roughly the pace
-- the shipped field's average drop did (about 0.95 of SHAFT_FALL). That
-- calibration is not cosmetic: a distribution whose mean sits below the
-- old constant is a shower that got quietly slower, thinner and less
-- often-landing everywhere at once, and every one of those reads as the
-- rain having been turned down rather than made of drops.

-- ------- how long a drop takes to notice the wind
--
-- This is the number that makes a gust look like a gust, and it is the one
-- thing a per-particle sine can never produce.
--
-- A drop does not travel WITH the air, it travels TOWARD it: pushed by
-- drag until its own sideways speed matches the air's, and the time that
-- takes goes with its mass over its drag -- so, with its terminal
-- velocity. A fine drop matches the air almost at once. A fat one takes
-- most of a second, and crosses the gust still going roughly where it was
-- already going.
--
-- Stand in a squall and that is exactly what you see: the front arrives
-- and the fine rain veers first, in a sheet, while the heavy drops keep
-- coming straight down through it. The rain SORTS ITSELF, and the sorting
-- is the picture. Give every drop the same response and the whole field
-- swings together like a curtain on a rail.

-- ------- and where a shaft stops being drawn
--
-- The reach used to end in a wall: past it a shaft was deleted and
-- respawned overhead at full brightness. Every one of those is a raindrop
-- blinking out and another blinking in, at a fixed radius around a player
-- who is walking -- so the far edge of the shower was a ring of popping
-- that travelled with you.
--
-- Now the last stretch of the reach is a fade, and a shaft that leaves has
-- been invisible for a while by the time it goes. Same for the first
-- moments of its life, which is what stops the respawn being a flash.
-- Both of these are small, and they are small because of how SHORT a
-- shaft's life is. It is spawned twenty to eighty pixels up and falls at
-- around a hundred a second, so it exists for about half a second -- which
-- means a fade-in of a fifth of a second is spent on nearly half of every
-- drop in the world, and the field loses a fifth of its brightness to a
-- transition nobody asked to see. The first pass at these numbers cost the
-- shower forty per cent of its ink; the screenshot measured it.
--
-- The edge band has the same trap in two dimensions: a band 30% deep on
-- each side of a square reach is HALF its area, so most of the rain was
-- standing in the fade rather than passing through it.
Weather.FADE_EDGE = 0.14          -- share of the reach spent fading out
Weather.FADE_IN = 0.06            -- seconds a fresh shaft spends arriving

-- ------- rain is not white
--
-- Water is clear. You see rain because it CATCHES light and throws a
-- little of it back, which means a streak is the colour of whatever is
-- lighting it and never a colour of its own. The palette above is rain at
-- NOON. Painting it unchanged at midnight is what makes a night shower
-- read as white scratches ruled over a dark picture -- the brightest thing

-- back the other way is a cycle. It is pushed in instead, exactly as
-- `Water.wet` is pushed the other way for the same reason: a hook this file
-- declares and that file fills in, nil until it does.
--
-- Rain landing everywhere EXCEPT in the standing water is the single thing
-- that made a wet street read as two unrelated effects bolted together --
-- pools that nothing touched, and splashes bursting off dry paving beside
-- them. So a splash rolls for a pool first and takes open ground only when
-- it cannot find one nearby, which is also what real rain looks like: you
-- see it in the water and barely at all on the road.

-- whatever it landed on, which is right on a route's dirt and sixteen pixels

-- ------- WHAT LANDS WHERE, AND HOW LOUD IT IS ALLOWED TO BE
--
-- Two separate questions, and running them together is what went wrong.
--
-- WHETHER the rain does something is a question with one answer: yes,
-- everywhere. A shower that visibly lands on the pond and passes through
-- the street without touching it is not a shower, it is an effect switched
-- on over one tile type -- and the street is where the player is standing.
--
-- WHAT it does is a different question with four answers, and only one of
-- them is loud. The crown, the collapsing cavity and the COLUMN thrown up
-- out of it are things a body of water does. Paving has no cavity to
-- collapse: a drop hitting stone bursts flat, small and quick. So a column
-- standing up out of a lawn is not rain, it is a sprinkler -- and that is
-- what was being drawn, because `Weather.poolAt` calls a grass cell
-- "holding water" during a shower and the pool branch routed it to the
-- water animation.
--
-- So the drawing is picked by surface (see pushImpact) and the size and
-- brightness with it. Everything still gets rain on it. Only water gets the
-- column.
--
-- The roll is weighted toward water rather than restricted to it: a pond in
-- frame should be visibly busier than the path beside it, which is what
-- rain actually looks like.

-- ------- WHAT A DROP ACTUALLY DOES WHEN IT LANDS

-- wave going out from the impact is what you see on a wet road from across
-- the street. But it is not what you see from two feet away, and this
-- camera is two feet away.
--
-- Close up, a drop hitting water does something much more specific. The
-- surface caves, the wall of the cavity climbs back up as a CROWN, the
-- crown becomes unstable and throws a handful of small drops off its rim,
-- and those drops fly up, arc over and fall back in. That is the whole
-- reason rain on a puddle reads as violent -- the water is being thrown
-- around, not merely rippled.
--
-- So a splash now spawns EJECTA: a few tiny ballistic drops off the rim,
-- with a real vertical velocity and real gravity, that land and are gone.
-- They cost a table each and no draw call of their own (they ride the same
-- mote loop as everything else here), and they are budgeted by surface,
-- because the surface is what decides how much water there is to throw:
--
--   WATER  the most, and the highest -- an open pond has depth to give
--   POOL   fewer, lower: a puddle is a film, and a film has little to give
--   GROUND one or two, barely -- this is spray off stone, not a crown

-- ------- WHY A RING FLOATS TWO PIXELS OFF WHAT IT LANDED ON
--
-- The rain shader's depth test (the T3 occlusion) compares each fragment

-- that wrote that depth is a tie -- which the small DEPTH_BIAS was meant
-- to forgive and, measured, does not: with the test armed, a shower held
-- two hundred live roof rings and two hundred and fifty stone rings and
-- painted NONE of them (probe_out_rainland; the player's own report was
-- "os pingos não atingem o chão"). Raising the bias is the wrong lever:
-- device depth is nonlinear, so a slack wide enough for a far tie starts
-- forgiving near geometry that really is in front. A WORLD-space raise
-- projects to exactly the right depth slack at every distance. Two
-- pixels is under the drawn thickness of the ring, so nothing visibly
-- hovers. Water keeps its own height: the pond ink is measured against
-- the recessed floor and was never eaten.

-- one random direction, kept only if that spot happened to be off the
-- roof. On a real building almost every hit is an INTERIOR tile, all four
-- of whose neighbours are more roof, so almost every call threw its drip
-- away: measured under a pinned downpour, SEVEN drips alive across a
-- whole town (tests/rain_interact_probe.lua). Seven one-pixel threads in
-- a nineteen-cell reach is not a roof dripping, it is noise.
--
-- Water on a pitched roof does not drop where it lands. It RUNS, and it
-- leaves at the edge -- and it leaves at the same low points every time,
-- which is why standing by a house in rain you watch one spot of the
-- pavement being hit over and over. Both halves matter and both were
-- missing:
--
--   THE WALK.  From the hit cell, walk roofward cells in a fixed
--   direction until the edge (a handful of cells at most). Every interior
--   hit now finds an eave instead of being discarded.
--
--   THE SPOT.  Which direction, and where along that edge, comes off a
--   HASH of the cell rather than a roll -- so a given roof tile drains to
--   the same point of the same eave forever. That repetition is the
--   entire difference between "drips" and "a gutter".
--
-- And the drop itself gets its two real phases: it HANGS at the eave,

-- eaves also drip on their own clock: a dart at a cell near the player,
-- kept if it is a lid, drained through the same walk as a hit. Same
-- pattern as the canopy's dart below, for the same O(1) reason.
--
-- Runs off the LARGER of the live power and the after-rain window (the
-- window squared -- a roof is sheet metal and tile, it drains in a
-- minute, not the wood's three), so walking past a house just after a
-- shower still means water off the eave in front of you.
Weather.EAVE_RATE = 26            -- ambient dart attempts per second

-- ------- AND THE SAME DART HAS TO CARRY TWICE THE LOAD ONCE THE SKY STOPS
--
-- While it rains the gutters have TWO sources, and the dart is the small
-- one: every roof splash also spawns a drip at EAVE_CHANCE, and with ~194
-- roof splashes live that source is most of what is on screen. Measured in
-- a pinned downpour over Pallet Town: 35 drips alive.
--
-- The moment the shower ends, that source is gone outright -- no shafts, no
-- splashes, no roof hits -- and the dart is left holding the whole effect
-- at the rate it was given as a SUPPLEMENT. The arithmetic of what that
-- leaves:
--
--   26 attempts/s
--   x ~0.23     the fraction of cells inside SHAFT_REACH that are a lid
--               (Pallet Town offers 83 of them; the reach is 361 cells)
--   x ~0.7 s    a bead hangs 0.18-0.52 s and then falls a roof's height at
--               ~85 px/s, so it exists for well under a second
--   = ~3 drips alive
--
-- Measured: 5. Five drips over a whole town is a mote count, not a
-- picture -- and it is the entire reason the after-rain read as empty
-- against a dry frame (signal/noise 1.0x on the pixel A/B).
--
-- So the after-rain regime gets its own rate, sized to land back on the
-- during-rain density it is standing in for: 30 = rate x 0.23 x 0.7 gives
-- ~186. The shower keeps the old number, because the shower still has its
-- roof hits and does not need the help -- raising one rate for both would
-- have bought a heavier storm to fix a problem the storm does not have.
--
-- DRIP_MAX still caps it at 72 live, so this cannot become the frame.

--
-- NEVER ITERATES THE FOREST. A route is 862 trees and this runs every

-- cost more than the whole weather system. Instead it throws a dart at a

-- O(1) read of a field that is already baked and already resident. The
-- reach is what makes it local, and the cover is what makes it land on

--

--   x ~0.25               most darts land on a cell with no crown over

--   = spawns/s
--   x ~0.25 s of LIFE     and this is the part that bites: a drop leaves
--                         a branch about DRIP_HEIGHT above the ground and
--                         falls at ~80 px/s, so it exists for a quarter

-- ------- THE STEP THAT MAKES IT WEATHER
--
-- What was here moved every drop in the world by the same vector: one
-- global wind speed, times sixteen, times dt. Every shaft, every size,
-- every position -- identical. That is not a shortcut with a cost in
-- realism, it is the ABSENCE of the effect: a field where every member
-- moves identically has no internal structure at all, so a gale and a
-- drizzle differ only in how fast the whole sheet slides sideways.
--
-- Two things replace it, and they are the two things that are actually
-- true about rain in wind:
--
--   THE AIR IS NOT THE SAME EVERYWHERE. It is asked for per drop, at that
--   drop's own position, out of the field the grass under it already rides
--   (Wind.flowAt). Drops close together get nearly the same answer and
--   drops a wood apart get different ones, so the shower arrives in
--   sheets -- and the sheet crossing the meadow is the same sheet bending
--   the meadow, because it is one field.
--
--   A DROP IS NOT THE AIR. It is pulled toward the air's velocity over its
--   own response time, which is longer for a heavy drop (see DRAG_SPAN).
--   So a gust front sorts the rain as it passes: the fine stuff veers
--   first and the fat drops plough through it. That sorting is most of
--   what a squall looks like, and no amount of per-particle noise
--   produces it, because noise has no front.
--
-- Vertical is untouched by any of it, which is also correct: a drop is at
-- terminal velocity by the time it reaches the frame and stays there.

-- ------- A RAIN STREAK IS A NEEDLE, NOT A BAR
--
-- What was here was `setLineWidth` + `g.line`, and a thick LOVE line is a
-- rectangle with square ends -- so every drop in the world was a white
-- stick of even brightness that stopped dead at both ends. Zoomed in on a
-- rain screenshot they read as poles standing in the air, which is exactly
-- what a rectangle is.
--
-- A falling drop does not look like that. It is brightest and widest where
-- the water is, and behind it is a thinning trail of where it just was. So
-- this draws a QUAD that is wide at the head and comes to a point at the
-- tail -- one draw call, same as the line it replaces, and the shape does
-- the work.
--
-- The bright head is a SECOND short needle rather than the square that
-- used to be stamped over the tip. A square head on a slanted streak sits
-- crooked on it at every angle except vertical, which was most of what
-- made the near drops look pasted on.
--
-- Two flat tones and no gradient, which is this file's rule and the right
-- one: a soft-edged raindrop over a cel-shaded diorama reads as a photo
-- filter. A taper is a SHAPE, not a blur.
-- ONE MESH FOR THE WHOLE SHOWER, and the colour lives in the vertices.
--
-- Three problems solved by the same change, which is why it is a mesh and
-- not another loop of primitives:
--
--   IT LOOKED PAINTED. Every drop was one flat colour from end to end, so
--   the field read as white sticks lying on the picture. Water does not
--   look like that: a falling drop is bright where the water IS and fades
--   to nothing along the trail behind it. Per-vertex alpha gives that for
--   free -- the head vertices carry the light, the tail vertices carry
--   almost none, and the hardware interpolates between them. There is no
--   way to draw that with a line or a polygon, which take one colour.
--
--   IT LOOKED OPAQUE. Rain is nearly clear: you see it because it CATCHES
--   light, not because it covers what is behind it. So this draws
--   ADDITIVE -- it brightens the trees and the sky rather than painting
--   over them -- which is also why the alphas below are far lower than the
--   ones the old opaque draw needed.
--
--   IT COST A DRAW CALL PER DROP. A hundred-odd setColor/line pairs per
--   frame is what kept the counts down, and thin rain is exactly what
--   makes a shower look fake. One buffer, one draw, and the density stops
--   being the thing being rationed.
--
-- g.polygon is also gone, and not only for cost: LOVE throws on a fill it
-- considers degenerate or self-intersecting, so a streak that happened to
-- collapse took the whole driver down mid-run. A mesh has no such opinion.
-- ------- A RAINDROP IS A LENS, NOT A LIGHT
--
-- Everything above draws the streak as ADDED light: a pale quad that
-- brightens whatever is behind it. That is a fair model of the highlight a
-- drop carries and a poor model of the drop, and the difference is the
-- whole of "it looks like a white thing falling out of the sky".
--
-- Water is CLEAR. You do not see a raindrop because it glows; you see it
-- because it is a little cylinder of glass hanging in the air, and three
-- things happen at once when you look through one:
--
--   IT BENDS what is behind it. A cylinder is a lens. The bend is zero
--   straight through the middle, grows toward the edge, and is worth the
--   most at about seventy per cent of the way out -- so a drop carries a
--   smeared, sideways-shifted little picture of the world behind it. This
--   is the part no amount of colour tuning can fake, because it is
--   parallax, and parallax needs the background.
--
--   IT CATCHES ONE HIGHLIGHT. A specular line down the side facing the
--   light, not an even glow along the whole width. A single bright edge is
--   what says "curved and wet"; an even glow says "drawn with a pen".
--
--   ITS RIM GOES DARK. At a grazing angle the surface stops transmitting
--   and starts reflecting away from you, so the outline of a drop is
--   DARKER than the sky behind it. Dark edges are most of what makes water
--   read as an object at all, and an additive quad can only ever get
--   brighter.
--
-- So the mesh carries two more things per vertex: where across the streak's
-- WIDTH the fragment is, and which way "across" points on screen. With
-- those the fragment shader can do all three, sampling a copy of the frame
-- taken just before the rain went on.
--
-- The additive path stays, unchanged, as the fallback: if the shader will
-- not compile on somebody's driver, or the copy cannot be made, the rain
-- is the pale quad it was rather than nothing.

  -- the way the wind field was -- and it is also why, until now, rain fell
  -- inside houses and splashes landed on top of the wall in front of them.
  --
  -- The fix is not to move them. It is to give each vertex the DEVICE
  -- depth of the world point it stands for (Voxel3D.projectDepth), so the
  -- shader can ask the frame's own depth buffer whether something is

-- ------- WHAT A DROP DOES WHEN IT LANDS, IN THREE PARTS
--
-- One expanding ring was the whole of it. A ring is what you see from
-- across the street, and this camera is not across the street -- so what
-- was drawn was the far-away reading of an impact happening two feet from
-- the lens, and no amount of tuning a ring fixes that, because the parts
-- that are missing are not rings.
--
-- A drop hitting standing water does three things, in order, and they
-- overlap:
--
--   THE CROWN.  The surface caves, and the wall of the cavity climbs. For
--   a moment there is a ring of raised water with points on it -- that is
--   the crown, and it is what makes rain on stone read as violent rather
--   than as decals blinking on and off. It is drawn as SPOKES: short
--   tapered strokes leaning up and out from the impact, bright at the
--   root, gone at the tip.
--
--   THE JET.  The cavity collapses, the walls meet at the middle, and the
--   water has nowhere to go but UP -- a thin vertical column, taller than
--   the crown was wide, that rises, hangs, and falls back. This is the
--   single most recognisable thing about rain on water and there was
--   nothing like it here at all. It is the tall spike in every photograph
--   of a raindrop landing.
--
--   THE RINGS.  Plural, and staggered. One ring is a decal. Two or three
--   leaving the same point a fraction of a second apart, each expanding
--   and thinning at its own rate, is a surface with waves on it.
--
-- Everything except the rings goes through the same additive mesh the rain
-- streaks use -- one buffer, one draw call for every crown and every jet
-- in the frame -- because a stroke leaning at an arbitrary angle is
-- exactly the tapered quad that buffer already makes, and because water
-- catching light should ADD light rather than paint over what is behind.

-- How tall the jet stands, as a multiple of the ring's own scale, and how
-- much of that a given impact actually gets. The spread is not decoration:
-- a pond in rain is a field of columns of every height, and a set of
-- identical ones reads as a fountain feature rather than as water being
-- hit.
Weather.JET_H = 3.8

-- ------- WHAT THE RAIN DOES WHEN IT ARRIVES, AND IT IS NEVER THE SAME TWICE
--
-- Two earlier answers are gone from here, and both of them failed for
-- reasons worth writing down, because both looked reasonable first.
--
-- ONE ANSWER FOR EVERY SURFACE. A crown, a column and a ring, played
-- wherever a drop landed. It is what water does and it is right for
-- exactly one of the things in this world: a column of water standing up
-- out of a lawn is not rain, it is a sprinkler, and it broke the picture
-- harder than having no splash at all.
--
-- SPRITE SHEETS. Three authored animations, one SpriteBatch each, and the
-- draw-call arithmetic was sound. The cost was not: measured on Route 1
-- against the same frame without them, the impacts alone were +21.9 ms --
-- against +6.4 ms for four hundred and forty falling drops and, to
-- everybody's surprise including this file's, MINUS two for the refraction
-- shader. Twenty-two milliseconds is a third of the frame budget spent on
-- the smallest thing on screen.
--
-- So: geometry again, and pushed into the SAME buffer the streaks already
-- use, which means the whole field of impacts costs no draw call of its
-- own at all -- it is drawn with the rain, because it IS the rain.
--
-- ------- and every surface gets its own
--
-- The rule is that nothing behaves like anything else, because in the
-- world nothing does:
--
--   WATER   the loud one, and the only loud one. The surface caves, the
--           cavity collapses, the walls meet in the middle and throw a
--           COLUMN up out of it -- taller than the crown was wide. Then
--           rings, plural and staggered, because a surface with waves on
--           it is what water is.
--
--   PUDDLE  a film over stone. There is no depth for a column to come out
--           of, so there is no column: one ring, wide and fast and flat,
--           and a couple of flecks off the rim. A puddle is loud in AREA
--           and quiet in HEIGHT, which is the opposite of the pond.
--
--   STONE   nothing rises at all. A drop hitting a hard flat plane
--           shatters SIDEWAYS -- a low star of spray going out almost
--           horizontally, gone in a fifth of a second, no ring. This is
--           the one that reads as "hard".
--
--   GRASS   nothing rises and nothing spreads. A blade is a springy edge:
--           it takes the drop, throws two small pieces of it UP and off to
--           one side, and springs back. The shortest-lived of all of them,
--           and the only one that is asymmetric.
--
--   ROOF    a tile is a hard surface at a SLANT, so the water does not
--           burst, it skids: one short streak running downhill from the
--           point of contact. What leaves the roof leaves off the eave,
--           which spawnDrip already handles.
--
--   CANOPY  nothing here at all, and that is the interaction. A crown
--           holds the water and lets it go minutes later
--           (spawnCanopyDrip), which is why standing under a tree after a
--           shower still gets you wet.

-- "dripping" from "the rain stopped and nothing replaced it".

-- ------- and the seam that stops a probe waiting out the weather
--
-- A shower BUILDS. The ramp is the feature -- the sky, the light, the
-- water and the air all arrive on one curve, over the better part of a
-- minute -- and a probe that pins the row and starts counting is measuring
-- a drizzle at a sixth of its power while believing it is looking at the
-- downpour. Which is exactly what the first run of the rain probe did.
--
-- So: set the state outright, the way forceStrike sets the lightning.
-- Probes only. Nothing in the mod calls this.

-- ------- AND WHY THE RAIN IS PAINTED TWICE OVER, IN TWO DIFFERENT PLACES
--
-- Because the tilt-shift was eating it, and from inside this file that was
-- invisible.
--
-- Weather.draw runs inside drawWorld, which paints the diorama's canvas --
-- and that canvas is then handed to TiltShift.apply, which blurs it. So
-- every streak this file drew as a hard-edged needle arrived on screen as a
-- soft grey smear four times wider than it was authored. Measured off four
-- screenshots of the same shower with the blur and the resolution switched
-- independently (tests/rain_look_probe.lua): the edge energy in the sky
-- band falls from 3.43 to 0.87 and the streaks fatten from seven pixels to
-- twenty-two. The RESOLUTION made almost no difference -- 3.43 against
-- 3.48. It was the blur, all of it.
--
-- Which is a thing the pipeline file had already solved twice: the
-- orientation radar and the start menu are BOTH re-painted after the blur,
-- for the stated reason that text and a HUD through a tilt-shift are
-- unreadable in a way a landscape is not. Rain is the third: a raindrop is
-- a hard little needle, and a hard little needle put through a depth-of-
-- field is not a soft raindrop, it is a smudge.
--
-- So when the blur is running the weather is drawn AFTER it, through this,
-- and drawWorld skips it; when the blur is off, drawWorld draws it as
-- before. One paint per frame either way -- main.lua owns that choice
-- because main.lua is where both passes live.
-- Is there anything at all for the screen-space pass to do this frame?
--
-- Weather.draw already answers this and returns early, but it answers it
-- AFTER Weather.present has bound the canvas -- and the canvas here is the
-- finished, panel-sized world. On a tiler that bind is a resolve of the whole
-- 3.31 Mpx target out to memory and a reload back in, paid on every frame of
-- a clear sky, which is most frames.
--
-- The test is deliberately "nothing to paint AND nothing to clean": drops and
-- shafts are cleared by Weather.draw's own early-out, and skipping the call
-- entirely must not strand them. The after-rain window keeps motes alive for
-- minutes after `kind` goes nil, and a lightning flash paints with no rain
-- power at all, so both are named here rather than assumed away.
