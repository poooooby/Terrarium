-- Overworld battles: the attack camera.
--
-- BattleCam answers "where should the camera be for this arena, this
-- instant" -- pure geometry, no history. This module is the OTHER half of
-- that sentence, the half SM64's camera taught everyone to separate: a
-- pursuer with inertia that chases whatever the geometry asks for, and a
-- director that asks for something different while a move is being thrown.
-- Mixing the two layers is what produces cameras stuck in feedback loops;
-- they are kept apart here on purpose (see camera-super-mario-64.md, the
-- doc this module's constants are lifted from).
--
-- The director watches three engine seams, all read-only:
--
--     battle.animPlaying / animAttackerIsPlayer   a move is being thrown,
--                                                 and by whom
--     battle.fx.flash / fx.shake                  the hit landed
--     battler.shownHP > battler.mon.hp            the bar is draining
--                                                 (the hit landed with
--                                                 animations switched off)
--
-- While a move plays, the goal swings around the arena's vertical axis
-- toward the attacker's end, stoops lower, punches the eye in and pulls the
-- aim toward the DEFENDER -- the impact is where the eye wants to be. When
-- the hit lands, a damped-cosine shake is added AFTER the smoothing, as an
-- angular offset on the finished frame: when it decays everything is back
-- exactly where it was, with no drift to clean up. When the move ends the
-- goal simply becomes the base rig again and the pursuer walks home, a
-- little slower than it left.
--
-- The pursuit is asymmetric, and the asymmetry is the feel: the focus
-- closes 80% of its horizontal error per 30fps frame while the eye closes
-- 30%, so the camera LOOKS at the action almost four times faster than it
-- travels there -- the mons never leave frame even when the framing is
-- still arriving. Vertical focus is 0.3 like the eye: a jolt in aim height
-- must not bounce the horizon. The eye is pursued in SPHERICAL coordinates
-- about the focus (distance, yaw, elevation), not in XYZ: interpolating
-- cartesian eye positions cuts the corner through the arena, spherical
-- interpolation arcs around it, which is what a camera operator would do.
--
-- The pins survive all of it for the same reason they survive the drift:
-- the mons are re-projected every frame (BattleScene.toGB), so wherever
-- this camera puts the frame, the pics follow. The swing and punch are
-- sized so both mons stay comfortably in front of the lens; toGB failing
-- (a mon BEHIND the camera) would retire the shot for the frame, so the
-- envelope below is deliberately conservative.
--
-- Purely presentational, like everything else in this mod: nothing here
-- reaches damage, timing or scripts, and a battle with the module confused
-- is a battle shot from the ordinary rig.

-- the mod namespace (see main.lua): V.require loads a sibling module

-- ------- how much room a narrow window leaves the swing/punch to work in
--
-- The envelope above (SWING, PUNCH, STOOP, FOCUS_PULL) was sized against a
-- comfortably wide window: the swing moves a mon about half a cell
-- laterally, which a wide frame absorbs without pushing anything toward
-- its own edge. On a narrow one there is less frame to absorb it in, and
-- the mons (and everything hung on them -- the name capsules, the message
-- panel) can end up pushed toward or past the edge purely from the
-- camera's own framing -- on top of BattleScene.narrowRoomFov's own
-- widening of the BASE rig's view, this keeps the attack camera's own
-- swing/punch from re-narrowing that room back down while a move plays.
--
-- A partial reduction still leaves a real swing/punch, and still
-- clipped on a genuinely tight window -- so this ramps steeply rather
-- than linearly: room is 0 (attack camera holds the base framing
-- exactly, the same one the idle "what will X do" screen already uses
-- cleanly) at or below LOW, 1 (full, untouched drama) at or above HIGH,
-- and linear between the two -- a window already at HIGH or past it
-- keeps the exact drama it always had.
