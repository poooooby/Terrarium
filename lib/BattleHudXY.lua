-- Overworld battles: the HUD, drawn rather than borrowed.
--
-- The mode already had an answer to "black glyphs on grass are not readable"
-- (lib/BattleHud.lua: frost the world behind them). That answer keeps the
-- GAME BOY's HUD -- a 4-shade block of tiles, 80x32, drawn by the engine's own
-- DrawEnemyHUDAndHPBar into the 160x144 UI canvas and lifted out of it. Over a
-- lit diorama with a 3D camera it reads as a screenshot pasted on, and no
-- amount of glass under it changes what it IS.
--
-- So this draws its own, out of the X/Y interface art: a capsule with the HP
-- trough milled into it, a coloured bar in the trough, the name and the level
-- in the series' own alphabet, and -- on the player's side only, exactly as
-- the games do it -- a slot of EXP under the capsule.
--
-- WHERE THE ART CAME FROM. A texture pack for the 3DS games, dumped at 5x
-- (`5X HUD/battle hud` and `5X HUD/text`). Dumps are named by content hash, so
-- nothing in them says which file is the player's frame and which is the
-- foe's; every box quoted below was MEASURED off the pixels -- see
-- data/hudxy_glyphs.lua for the glyph strips and TROUGH/EXP_SLOT for the two
-- holes in the frames. Re-cutting the art means re-measuring, not guessing.
--
-- WHAT IT DOES NOT DO. There is no gender mark. The sheet carries one and
-- Generation 1 has no such field -- gender arrived in Generation 2 -- so
-- drawing it would mean inventing a fact about the mon. The sheet's Mega
-- Evolution badge is unused for the same reason.
--
-- KNOWN ARTEFACT, and it is NOT this file's. A solid blue rectangle sits above
-- the player's EXP slot, at window x849..958 / y469..478 in a 1024x768 frame,
-- in RGB (50, 150, 250). It is the GAME BOY's own EXP bar, in the position the
-- band blit puts it, left behind on the world canvas. Everything below is
-- measured by tests/hudxy_probe.lua:
--   * it is not drawn by anything here -- switching BattleHudXY.ENABLED off
--     with the player's side LIVE leaves it exactly where it was, all 1100
--     pixels of it;
--   * it is not a live draw at all -- it comes back at exactly 1100 pixels in
--     six consecutive shots, including ones where the HP bar had moved from
--     full to a fifth. A live element would vary; a stale composite does not;
--   * it is not the band being blitted now -- the branch counters report 94
--     frames of `player.xy` and zero band blits over the very window the
--     picture was taken in;
--   * repainting EXP_COLOR and HP_HIGH magenta in turn moves the bars and
--     leaves the rectangle untouched;
--   * the art is innocent: frame_player.png has zero pixels of that blue and
--     the build's copy is byte-identical to the repo's.
-- SOLVED (2026-08-17), and the "stale composite" theory this note used to
-- close on was WRONG. The bar is a LIVE draw by the quality_of_life mod's
-- XP BAR feature (qol_feature_xp_bar.lua): its drawExpBar reads
-- `dramaticShapeShot` off the battle and paints straight onto the world
-- canvas at the snapped band's position, every frame, after this mod's own
-- draw. It measured as constant because EXP does not change mid-battle --
-- a live draw of a constant number is pixel-identical to a stale one, which
-- is what fooled the six-shot test. The branch counters never saw it
-- because it is not this mod's branch.
--
-- The fix is IN the QoL mod, by its own design language: its drawExpBar now
-- skips battles marked `terrariumXYBox` (the field BattleBoxXY.claim
-- rawsets), because this capsule already draws the same EXP in its own
-- slot. That patch lives in the INSTALLED copy of quality_of_life, not in
-- any repo -- reinstalling that mod resurrects the bar.

local V = ...
