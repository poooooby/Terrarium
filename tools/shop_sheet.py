"""Author the Poke Mart interior's TEXEL SHEET (assets/shop/shop_sheet.png).

The Mart's tileset is four greys under one flat palette. A voxel wears a
texel of whatever atlas its model was read from, so a room built off the
tileset can only ever be a grey box -- which is exactly what the old
lib/RoomKit.lua Mart was. The facade solved this in 2026-09 by standing the
building on an authored RGBA sheet (tools/mart_facade.py); the interior does
the same, one texel per voxel, and gets real colour for free.

THE SHEET IS A CONTRACT. lib/ShopKit.lua indexes it by the swatch table
below and refuses to build (falling back to RoomKit) if the PNG's size does
not match SHEET_W/SHEET_H. Bands are 16 rows tall and each band is ONE
MATERIAL, because lib/Voxel3D.lua's shop materials pick the photo detail to
modulate from the texel's v alone -- a 1-D lookup, no branching on u.

    band  rows      material          contents
    0     0.. 15    wall plaster      paint, skirting, cornice, case backing
    1    16.. 31    flat/emissive     ceiling panel, light diffuser, vent
    2    32.. 47    painted metal     shelf uprights, boards, cabinets, kick
    3    48.. 63    wood laminate     counter top, front, edge band
    4    64.. 79    glass             cooler and case panes, mullion, glow
    5    80..127    none (flat art)   products, 8x8 faces, 32 x 6 grid
    6   128..255    none (flat art)   signage, register, basket, mat, boxes

Photo grain comes from the Poly Haven CC0 textures in assets/shop/ when they
are present (assets/shop/README.md says which): each band's swatches are the
authored colour MODULATED by a crop of the matching photo, normalised so the
mean is the authored colour exactly. Without them the sheet is flat colour
and the room still builds -- the shader's material pass is the other half of
the detail either way.

# ------------------------------------------------------------- the palette --
#
# A konbini under fluorescent light: warm off-white walls, cool steel, one
# saturated brand blue on the counter front, and products that are the only
# strong colour in the room. Hex here, so a retune is one table.
# ------- the two families, and why they are two
#
# Measured on the shipped frames (assets/docs/shop/DRESSING.md): 52.6 % of
# the room sat in the top value decile, 75 % under saturation 0.10, and one
# swatch -- #F8F8F8 -- owned 25.2 % of it. Nine surfaces that are different
# objects were reading as ONE 46 % mass, which is most of what "the room
# looks like a white box" actually is. No amount of chamfering fixes that:
# a silhouette needs two values on either side of it to be a silhouette.
#
# So the palette is split, and the split is the room's own physics:
#
#   THE SHELL   walls, cornice, ceiling, counter edge. Painted plaster and
#               laminate under a ceiling of tubes: WARM and the palest
#               thing in the room, because it is what the light lands on.
#   THE FIXTURES gondolas, cabinets, cases, uprights, housings. Powder
#               coated steel: COOL, and a full stop darker. In a real
#               fitout the shelving is always darker than the wall behind
#               it -- that is how a shop reads as depth rather than as a
#               diagram, and it is free.
