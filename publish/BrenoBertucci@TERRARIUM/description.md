# Terrarium

A little world under glass: weather, day/night, and a full 3D diorama overworld for Gen1Recomp.

## Fork notice

**Terrarium is a fork of [Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod](https://github.com/DramaticShape/DramaticShapeVoxelMod) by [DramaticShape](https://github.com/DramaticShape).** The diorama, depth-buffered occlusion, shadow map, tilt-shift, and over-the-shoulder battles are his work. Look at the original first if you are choosing between them.

This fork is **independent**: different mod id (`TERRARIUM`), different install folder, different pipeline registry keys (`terrarium_voxel` / `terrarium_tiltshift`), and letter hotkeys so it can sit **beside** upstream `DRAMATIC_SHAPE` without overwriting it or fighting its digit hotkeys.

## Install

1. Import the release zip through FIND MODS / Import, or drop the folder into `mods/TERRARIUM`.
2. Enable **Terrarium** in the mod manager.
3. Optional: keep **Dramatic Shape Voxel Mod** installed too -- they do not share folder or id.

## Hotkeys (this fork)

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `v` | VOXEL camera ladder |
| `g` | V-GRID wireframe |
| `t` | T-SHIFT miniature blur |
| `c` | V-CURVE horizon |
| `m` | SM64CAM Mario 64 camera |
| `b` | 3D-BTL overworld battles |
| `n` | WILD roam mode |
| `p` | Minimap |
| `h` | V-HAZE aerial perspective |
| `k` | HORIZON far silhouettes |

Upstream Dramatic Shape still uses `3` / `5` / `6` / `7` / `8` / `9`.

## Features (high level)

- 3D extruded overworld with cast shadows and tilt-shift
- Day/night cycle, weather, puddles and snow on the ground
- Wild Pokemon visible in the grass; ecology / shelter / city life systems
- Tuned defaults for lower-end / mobile hardware

## New in 1.36.0-beta

**Beta para testes e nada mais.**

The Town Map rebuilt from the classic picture as a 3D diorama (every town,
route, cave and landmark where the Game Boy puts them; objective routed
along the roads; classic inset; MAP 3D / CLASSIC row; US English).
Swimmers drag the water: foam collar, churned wash, V wake, bow push, foam
trail, splash in, drip out, the card rocking on the swell. Snow refills a
trail under the fall, landed flakes join the cover, prints keep a packed
floor, and the cover reaches the boots and no further.

## New in 1.35.0-beta

**Beta para testes e nada mais.**

Puddles as a depth field, snow as a surface with tracks, leaves on the
ground, rain drips off figures, silhouette through trees.

## New in 1.34.5-beta

**Beta para testes e nada mais.**

Shop, crypt and tower interiors went black on Android: Bloom's film grain
overflowed fp16 on the present canvas. The grain is now the same interleaved
gradient noise RayFX already used.

## New in 1.34.1-beta

**Fixes 1.34.0-beta, which took the 3D mode off phones entirely.** That build put `precision highp float;` into the pixel stage unconditionally, and LOVE forward-declares `effect` at its own mediump default BEFORE a mod's source is concatenated -- so the definition had highp parameters against a mediump prototype, which GLSL ES refuses. No shader, no mode, flat 2D. Desktop cannot see it: there both qualifiers are `#define`d to nothing and they agree trivially.

- `effect()` now pins its own float parameters to `mediump`, so it matches LOVE's prototype whatever the default is.
- The precision statement became **a rung of the shader ladder** (`FRAG_HIGHP`), tried first and **dropped** if the driver refuses -- the same fallback the vertex taps and the crypt samplers already have. The worst case is now the fp16 fragment stage every Android build has always run: a picture with static in it, rather than no picture. `tests/gpu_compat_probe.lua` gained the case that proves the drop works, and `tools/essl1_check.py` the assertion that keeps the prototype matched.

## New in 1.34.0-beta

**Television static on Mali, and why it was only there.** A GLES fragment shader defaults to `mediump` -- LOVE emits exactly that at the top of every pixel shader it builds -- and `mediump` on a phone is fp16, which has a resolution of ONE at a magnitude of 1024. This shader works in world pixels, and a city is more than a thousand of them across, so every position, every shadow lookup and every one of the six `fract(sin(dot(...)) * 43758.5)` hashes was being computed on a number quantised to about a whole world pixel -- a quantisation that shifts as the camera moves, amplified on purpose. That is the static. One `precision highp float;`, guarded on `GL_ES` **and** `GL_FRAGMENT_PRECISION_HIGH` and confined to the pixel stage, fixes all of it; both halves of that guard are load-bearing and the wrong spelling takes the whole shader down on desktop (measured, twice).

- The water's ordered dither was a checkerboard on a fixed **2 canvas pixels**, which is 2 display pixels at RES FULL and **eight** at the 1/4 that AUTO picks on a 3.31 Mpx panel -- so the dither had become the pattern. The cell and its amplitude now follow RES, and FULL and 1/2 are unchanged exactly.
- **New DIAG row** (default OFF): prints what the build is over the corner of the screen -- version, GPU, mobile detection, panel and dpiscale, which shader rung the driver took, what every row resolves to, whether each kit loaded, and how many models the current map built. A phone cannot be asked anything and a screenshot is the only channel out of one; this makes that screenshot an answer.
- **New `tools/essl1_check.py`**: the two GLES2 rules that have taken the 3D mode off a phone, asserted as text against the shipped source, in a second and with no GPU.

## New in 1.33.0-beta

**The 3D mode on a phone.** A Poco X7 (Mali-G615 MC2, 2712x1220) ran the VOXEL row at about one frame a second, with every "mobile" default already applied. The cause was not any of them: `love.graphics.newCanvas(w, h)` multiplies by the panel's dpiscale, which on Android is 2.625, so **every render target in the mod was 6.9x the pixels the code asked for** -- the present canvas alone was 22.8 megapixels, seven times the area of the screen it is shown on, blitted every frame. That is why turning RES down never helped: RES divides a number that is then multiplied back twice.

- **RES = AUTO** is the new default: a pixel budget picks the first frame (1/4 on that phone, FULL on a desktop) and a governor walks the ladder from there, aiming at 30 fps. It cannot oscillate, it ignores mesh-build hitches, and it works on a device that is slow everywhere. Two new rungs below the old floor: **1/6** and **1/8**.
- **SCREEN FX = AUTO** (the row was called RTX then), which is OFF on a tile-based mobile GPU: the SSR rung marches thirteen dependent depth fetches per pixel and forces the scene's depth buffer to be a readable canvas.
- The sun pass no longer destroys and rebuilds two render targets **every frame**, and its every-other-frame redraw -- which had never once fired -- now works.
- Clears before every full-coverage blit (a tiler reloads the whole target otherwise), chunk textures re-bound only when they change, and neighbouring maps that are out of frame no longer submit their grass, flowers, lamps and trees.
- On the desktop this was developed on the frame went from 25.0 ms to the 60 fps vsync ceiling at every measured setting, and from 148 to 110 draw calls -- and eight maps of pixel-diff say the picture did not change.

Full detail, including two optimisations that were implemented, measured and reverted, is in `MOBILE.md`.

## New in 1.32.0-beta

**Beta para testes e nada mais.**

## New in 1.31.0-beta

**Beta para testes e nada mais.**

The zip includes the battle UI art, so the Clair Obscur staged fight
looks the same for everyone who downloads it.

## New in 1.30.1

If the 3D mode never came up for you on Android, this is the build.

- **The diorama builds on Adreno.** The scene shader was one veto: any
  construct the driver refused took the whole 3D mode with it, silently,
  with the OPTIONS row still reading ON. Two things in it are legal for a
  GLES2 driver to refuse -- three texture taps in the vertex stage where the
  driver may expose zero vertex texture units, and ten fragment samplers
  where eight are guaranteed -- and Adreno refuses. Both are optional at
  compile time now, and the build walks a ladder: full, then without the
  vertex taps, then without the crypt's stone, then without either. Only the
  bottom rung failing means no 3D.
- **And it says why.** If the mode still cannot build, the game now prints a
  report -- your GPU, the driver, and the driver's own error for every
  refusal -- and writes `TERRARIUM-gpu-report.txt` beside the save. Paste
  that whole block into a bug report.
- **The crypt's ring is one wall.** The white seams down the Tower's stepped
  walls are gone: the ring was a stack of separate 16px models, each emitting
  all four sides, so every step and every run-end showed a lit strip of the
  outer stone with the wall's black core behind it.

## New in 1.30.0

The tower of graves has an inside.

- **CRYPT (NEW / CLASSIC).** The Pokemon Tower's seven floors and Agatha's
  room stand as a crypt: ashlar climbing out of the light, headstones on
  plinths, candle lanterns, violet air, wisps from the graves, dark
  flagstones. CLASSIC is the old pins.
- **CRYPT-FX.** Real face lighting, wet sheen, ground mist, CC0 stone
  from Poly Haven, bloom and candle shafts. ~4.5 ms on 4F with it on.

## New in 1.29.0

First tag without `-mobile`. The arena answers the blow. Houses breathe.
A ledge is a bank. The tower of graves is a tower.

- **COMBAT.** The hit reaches the room: spotlight, typed flash, cubes off
  the floor, a mark under the defender, gold damage, glass that leans and
  cracks. Move cards wear their element. CLASSICA still holds still.
- **LEDGES (BANK / CLASSIC).** Hop-down tiles stand as earth banks, grass
  on top, steep on the high side.
- **HAUNT.** Lavender's tower is a tower. Cold glass after dark, wisps
  from the lantern.
- **HEARTH.** Chimneys smoke.
- **WATER.** The water has a bed.
- **Centers and Marts are rooms** (counters, machine, shelves) — not boxes.
- **Mon pack (optional).** Gen 5 battle sprites via
  `python tools/install_mon_pack.py` — not in the zip, same rule as roamers.

## New in 1.28.0-mobile

The fight is staged. The Pokemon Center is a drawing. The wind is a brush.

- **COMBAT row (DINAMICA / CLASSICA).** The camera swings in behind the
  attacker. Menu, dialog and move cards float on glass in the arena. HP
  capsules hang beside their mons. Hits send a shockwave and a typed
  sheet at the blow. CLASSICA holds still. Safe to flip mid-battle.
- **Pokemon Centers voxelized** from UlithiumDragon's XY-inspired Center
  + Mart drawing. Warps and collision unchanged.
- **Wind field redrawn** with Pimen / EdgeLoopRepeat strips (use-in-a-game
  licence; not CC0 — see `assets/vfx/LICENSE.md`). Grey specks over the
  path are gone.

## New in 1.27.0-mobile

The air has physics. The rain stops falling through the world. The camera
can be Mario 64's.

- **SM64CAM (`m`).** Super Mario 64's camera on the overworld, off by
  default. It orbits you at a bearing only you change, a quarter turn at
  a time -- it never turns on its own -- the D-pad turns with it, and
  characters face the eye instead of lying flat or moonwalking. `q`/`e`
  turn, `r` puts it at your back, `f` zooms, the right stick turns freely.
- **PFX row.** Particle amount is its own axis (LOW / ON / HIGH / MAX),
  not a side-effect of RES.
- **Rain occludes.** Shafts no longer draw through roofs, walls and the
  ground. Wind motes are geometry in the scene pass, not an overlay.
- **The world sheds.** Footsteps kick dust, trees drop leaves, wind pulls
  spray off the shore -- one air solver, real sites.
- **After-rain drips for real.** The eave rate after a shower finally
  matches the storm it stands in for.
- **TREES row (3D / VOXEL).** The forest can go back to the classic
  voxel hulls. The 3D grass tuft path is retired; tall grass is the
  slab (still sways, still crushes).

## Play Gen 1. Gold is not ready.

**Do not use Terrarium on Pokémon Gold / Johto yet.** This release is
recommended on **Red, Blue and Yellow only**. Gen 2 is an early first
pass: the diorama can boot and draw, but most of the fork (wild roamers,
ecology, shelter, routines, the XY battle UI, horizon, minimap) is
unported or untested there.

## New in 1.26.0-mobile

- **Gold first pass, not a Johto release.** The mod loads on the engine's
  Gold (Beta) column: neighbor Map instances, a palette-baked terrain
  atlas, cell-rule ground heights, warp-kind doors, and a v1 on-map
  battle (enemy on the field, back sprite still in the panel). Stay on
  Gen 1.

## New in 1.25.0-mobile

- **Premium building kit.** Roofs overhang, window panes recess with a
  sill, facades pick up baked corner AO, and night windows light room by
  room. The Indigo Plateau and the Victory Road entrance stand.

## New in 1.23.1-mobile

- **Day posts are a neighbourhood, not a tile.** Wanderers were walking back
  to the exact cell all day and the town looked emptier than Gen 1. Within
  three cells they wander as they always did. A night doorway is still one
  cell.

## New in 1.23.0-mobile

The battle is drawn at the window. The birds are the right size. People
in town have somewhere to be.

- **Command menu, moves, party and bag at window resolution.** The fight
  prompt stays in the box; X/Y buttons float on the right. The move list
  is one row per move in that type's colour. Party and bag sit on the
  diorama instead of a white 160x144 page. The bag has DS pockets
  (ITENS / CURA / BOLAS / TM/HM).
- **Flock birds scale by species.** A Fearow is bigger than a Pidgey,
  from the same size table the ground roamers already use. Towns get
  Pidgey instead of grey chevrons.
- **Townsfolk keep an agenda.** Wanderers go to a post by day and a
  doorway after dark -- never in front of you, never a trainer. New
  AGENDA row (OFF / DAY / FULL). Shelter still wins over the clock.

## New in 1.22.0-mobile

Trees, rain, and the street lamps that were never actually loading.

- **Trees are trees.** Round-tree sites wear a real 3D willow instead of the
  round hull carved from the tileset. The forest builds across frames so a
  route does not hitch while it appears.
- **A wood stays dry underneath.** The crown keeps puddles off the ground
  it covers, and snow thins in patches rather than a clean circle. Rain
  still falls behind a wall -- that is a different kind of shelter.
- **Rain looks like water.** Streaks brighten what is behind them, fade
  along their length, and lean with the wind. After the shower the canopy
  keeps dripping for a few minutes.
- **Town lamps are the authored post again.** A host filesystem proxy was
  swallowing the bake, so every town silently drew the box templates. The
  lantern now lights from the glass, and posts on the next map over stay
  visible when you stand on the seam.

## Coming next

### Readable wild Pokémon (optional art)

WILD roamers can wear **Gen 2-style walk sheets** (16×96) instead of a
shrunk battle portrait. **Those sheets are not in the zip** — same rule as
the X/Y GUI pack.

python tools/install_roamer_sprites.py
```

Details: `assets/roamers/CREDITS.md`.

## New in 1.21.0-mobile

The grass remembers.

- **Routes develop paths where people actually walk.** Every grass cell keeps a
  wear value that climbs when somebody crosses it and recovers over in-game
  days. It rides your save file, so a route you have crossed forty times looks
  crossed forty times.
- **And it is not only you writing it.** Wild Pokemon and the civilians on
  their routines wear the ground down too, at their own weight -- so a route
  grows desire paths along the traffic that really crosses it, including
  corners you have never stood in.
- **Worn grass THINS, it does not shrink.** Individual tufts drop out of a
  trampled cell rather than the whole patch getting shorter, and the earth
  under them shows through as trodden dirt. A path you can look back at.
- **Lightning leaves a scar.** A ground strike burns the grass where it lands,
  and that mark outlives a footpath by a good part of the journey.
- **Grass is calm behind buildings.** The wind now goes around a house instead
  of through it, so a sheltered meadow stands still while the open field waves.
- **Cut clears a cell, and the cell regrows.** Tall grass you cut has no wild
  encounter until it grows back -- so a corridor through a forest is something
  you can make, and something that expires.

## In 1.20.0-mobile

The water.

- **Small water finally moves like small water.** A pond used to carry the
  open sea's swell at a tenth of the height and at half the speed, which reads
  as an ocean filmed in slow motion. It now carries a short chop of its own,
  travelling at the speed a wave that length actually travels.
- **Shorelines stopped fraying.** Along every bank far from the middle of the
  world the wave was quietly coming apart into noise -- for a while now, and
  invisibly to every test the mod had. It is a wave everywhere again.
- **The sun glints off the water.** It always meant to. The window a crest had
  to reach to catch the light was fixed, while how far a crest can tilt depends
  on how big the swell is, so outside of dawn and dusk nothing ever reached it.
  Now the window follows the water, and a still pond sparkles as well as a sea.

The open sea is deliberately untouched: same waves, same directions, same
lengths as the previous build.

## New in 1.19.0-mobile

The sky, and how far away everything is.

- **You can see the rain coming.** A curtain of it stands on the horizon as
  vertical shafts, and it fills in while the drops near you are still nothing
  -- so the weather arrives as something you watch approach for the better
  part of a minute instead of something that switches on.
- **Clouds travel over Kanto, not over your monitor.** The deck reads the
  camera now, and it shifts *less* than everything else on screen, which is
  what makes it read as far away. It also changes shape while it drifts,
  instead of being one rigid pattern towed past.
- **God rays after a shower**, thrown where the deck is breaking up -- light
  through the gaps, not a glow pasted over the sun. In hard steps with the
  same dither as the rest of the sky, so it stays painted rather than bloomed.
- **A storm sky.** Heavy rain now bruises the sky violet instead of only
  greying it -- and only the rain heavy enough to throw lightning does, so a
  purple sky is a promise. A drizzle looks exactly as it always did.
- **Stars go out one at a time** as cloud comes over, scattered, faint ones
  first, rather than the whole field dimming together.
- **V-HAZE** (`h`): the far ground goes paler and bluer with distance. Equal
  contrast reads as equal distance, and that one cue is most of why a map used
  to feel the size of one screen.
- **HORIZON** (`k`): the rest of Kanto standing on the skyline. The maps were
  never missing -- the game already knows where eight to twenty-one of them
  sit relative to you -- they were just never drawn.
- **ANIME** (OFF / CEL / FULL): cel-banded light, rim light and an ink line,
  with no new render pass at any rung.
- **IMPACT**: hand-drawn sprite-sheet effects (CC0 packs, see
  `assets/vfx/LICENSE.md`).

Every sky change above was isolated and measured rather than eyeballed -- they
all landed in one shader, where a screenshot cannot tell you which of them
moved. The whole lot costs under 5% of a sky paint, measured at a ceiling the
game never actually reaches.

## Previously, in 1.18.0-mobile

The tall grass is geometry out here, and that release made it behave like it.

- **WIND / AUTO**, the new default. BREEZE and GALE are two fixed windows onto
  the same climate, so keeping a storm feeling like a storm meant a trip back
  to the options menu every time the sky changed. AUTO spans both on one
  curve: near-still on a calm night, breeze by day, gale on its own under a
  front.
- **Grass that bends instead of sliding.** The tip drops as it goes over
  rather than stretching sideways, every tuft has its own stiffness and phase
  so a meadow is many plants rather than one animated surface, and the gust
  arrives in bands that travel across it.
- **Weather lands ON the grass.** Rain is weight: it damps the sway and adds a
  fast tick as drops hit. Settled snow bows the tufts over, stiffens them, and
  now piles white on the crowns with green showing underneath -- before this,
  a meadow stood green beside ground that had gone white.
- **Walk through it and it lies down**, springs back past upright, and leaves
  a **trail** behind you that recovers over a few seconds. Stop, turn round,
  and the way you came is still there.
- **Wind you can see off the grass**: dust on a clear day, spray under a
  shower, blown white under a fall -- plus a gust front that crosses the frame
  as a line while the meadow bows under it.

## Optional setup (not in the zip)

| what | why missing | install |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X/Y HUD / menu / battle box art | third-party pack; no redistributable licence | `python tools/extract_xy_assets.py <pack folder>` |
| Gen-2-style wild / town walk sprites | fan overworld art; same licence rule | `python tools/install_roamer_sprites.py` |

Without them the mod still runs: HUD falls back to Game Boy panels, roamers
fall back to a greyscale bake.
